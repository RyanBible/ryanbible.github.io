            <h4>The city of Philipi at 60AD</h4>
			<p>Named Φίλιπποι (Philippoi) by Philip II of Macedon in 356 BC</p>
            <p>From the battle of Philipi in 42 BC the city became increasingly more Roman. By 27 BC the territory of Philippi was centuriated (divided into squares of land) which were distributed to Roman colonists and constructed a Roman forum and theatre. It was a "miniature Rome," under the municipal law of Rome and governed by two military officers, the duumviri, who were appointed directly from Rome.
			<p>The colony was weathly due to its Gold mines and its position on the Via Egnatia trade route. </p>

            <h4>The Church in Philipi</h4>
			<p>Paul + Silas vist Philipi on Paul's second missionary journey. They stay there for several days (Acts 16:12). On the Sabbath day they went outside the city gate, where they thought there would be a place of prayer (Synagogue), and they spoke to the women who had assembled there. A God-fearing Greek called Lydia who is a migrant from Thyatiera (in Galatia across the Aegean Sea) and her household were baptised along with a slave girl who could see the future. They got beaten and put in prison because of the loss of profits to the slave girls owners. When they were praying and singing God released them and the prison doors open due to an earthquake. The don't leave and then the Jailer and his family get saved. Afterwards they reveal that they are Roman citizens and have been beaten without a proper trial. P+S then leave the city.</p>

All of you share in God’s grace with me while I am in prison and while I am defending and proving the truth of the Good News. <sup>8&nbsp;</sup>God knows that I want to see you very much, because I love all of you with the love of Christ Jesus.

            <p>
                <sup>12&nbsp;</sup>I want you brothers and sisters to know that what has happened to me has helped to spread the Good News. <sup>13&nbsp;</sup>All the palace guards and everyone else knows that I am in prison because I am a believer in Christ. <sup>14&nbsp;</sup>Because I am in prison, most of the believers have become more bold in Christ and are not afraid to speak the word of God.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>15&nbsp;</sup>It is true that some <span class="wordcomment" data-comment="κηρύσσω (kérussó).

            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>18&nbsp;</sup>But it doesn’t matter. The important thing is that in every way, whether for right or wrong reasons, they are preaching about Christ.

I do not know what to choose—living or dying. <sup>23&nbsp;</sup>It is hard to choose between the two. I want to leave this life and be with Christ, which is much better, <sup>24&nbsp;</sup>but you need me here in my body. <sup>25&nbsp;</sup>Since I am sure of this, I know I will stay with you to help you grow and have joy in your faith. <sup>26&nbsp;</sup>You will be very happy in Christ Jesus when I am with you again.

                    <sup>6&nbsp;</sup>Christ himself was like God in everything.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he did not think that being equal with God was something to be used for his own benefit.<br>
                    <sup>7&nbsp;</sup>But he gave up his place with God and made himself nothing.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was born as a man<br>

            <p>
                <sup>12&nbsp;</sup>My dear friends, you have always obeyed God when I was with you. It is even more important that you obey now while I am away from you.

                <sup>14&nbsp;</sup>Do everything without complaining or arguing. <sup>15&nbsp;</sup>Then you will be innocent and without any wrong. You will be God’s children without fault. But you are living with crooked and mean people all around you, among whom you shine like stars in the dark world. <sup>16&nbsp;</sup>You offer the teaching that gives life. So when Christ comes again, I can be happy because my work was not wasted. I ran the race and won.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>17&nbsp;</sup>Your faith makes you offer your lives as a sacrifice in serving God. If I have to offer my own blood with your sacrifice, I will be happy and full of joy with all of you. <sup>18&nbsp;</sup>You also should be happy and full of joy with me.

I will be happy to learn how you are. <sup>20&nbsp;</sup>I have no one else like Timothy, who truly cares for you. <sup>21&nbsp;</sup>Other people are interested only in their own lives, not in the work of Jesus Christ. <sup>22&nbsp;</sup>You know the kind of person Timothy is. You know he has served with me in telling the Good News, as a son serves his father. <sup>23&nbsp;</sup>I plan to send him to you quickly when I know what will happen to me. <sup>24&nbsp;</sup>I am sure that the Lord will help me to come to you soon.

            <p>
                <sup>25&nbsp;</sup>Epaphroditus, my brother in Christ, works and serves with me in the army of Christ. When I needed help, you sent him to me. I think now that I must send him back to you, <sup>26&nbsp;</sup>because he wants very much to see all of you. He is worried because you heard that he was sick. <sup>27&nbsp;</sup>Yes, he was sick, and nearly died, but God had mercy on him and me too so that I would not have more sadness. <sup>28&nbsp;</sup>I want very much to send him to you so that when you see him you can be happy, and I can stop worrying about you. <sup>29&nbsp;</sup>Welcome him in the Lord with much joy. Give honor to people like him, <sup>30&nbsp;</sup>because he almost died for the work of Christ. He risked his life to give me the help you could not give in your service to me.

                The Importance of Christ

            <p>
                <a class="ch">3</a>My brothers and sisters, be full of joy in the Lord. It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it will help you to be more ready. <sup>2&nbsp;</sup>Watch out for those who do evil, who are like dogs, who demand to cut<sup data-fn="#fen-NCV-29303a" data-link="[<a href=&quot;#fen-NCV-29303a&quot; title=&quot;See footnote a&quot;>a</a>]"></sup> the body. <sup>3&nbsp;</sup>We are the ones who are truly circumcised. We worship God through his Spirit, and our pride is in Christ Jesus. We do not put trust in ourselves or anything we can do, <sup>4&nbsp;</sup>although I might be able to put trust in myself. If anyone thinks he has a reason to trust in himself, he should know that I have greater reason for trusting in myself. <sup>5&nbsp;</sup>I was circumcised eight days after my birth. I am from the people of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin. I am a Hebrew, and my parents were Hebrews. I had a strict view of the law, which is why I became a Pharisee. <sup>6&nbsp;</sup>I was so enthusiastic I tried to hurt the church. No one could find fault with the way I obeyed the law of Moses. <sup>7&nbsp;</sup>Those things were important to me, but now I think they are worth nothing because of Christ. <sup>8&nbsp;</sup>Not only those things, but I think that all things are worth nothing compared with the greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. Because of him, I have lost all those things, and now I know they are worthless trash. This allows me to have Christ <sup>9&nbsp;</sup>and to belong to him. Now I am right with God, not because I followed the law, but because I believed in Christ. God uses my faith to make me right with him. <sup>10&nbsp;</sup>I want to know Christ and the power that raised him from the dead. I want to share in his sufferings and become like him in his death. <sup>11&nbsp;</sup>Then I have hope that I myself will be raised from the dead.

            <h3>
                Continuing Toward Our Goal
            </h3>
            <p>
                <sup>12&nbsp;</sup>I do not mean that I am already as God wants me to be. I have not yet reached that goal, but I continue trying to reach it and to make it mine. Christ wants me to do that, which is the reason he made me his. <sup>13&nbsp;</sup>Brothers and sisters, I know that I have not yet reached that goal, but there is one thing I always do. Forgetting the past and straining toward what is ahead, <sup>14&nbsp;</sup>I keep trying to reach the goal and get the prize for which God called me through Christ to the life above.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>15&nbsp;</sup>All of us who are spiritually mature should think this way, too. And if there are things you do not agree with, God will make them clear to you. <sup>16&nbsp;</sup>But we should continue following the truth we already have.
            </p>
            <p>
                <sup>17&nbsp;</sup>Brothers and sisters, all of you should try to follow my example and to copy those who live the way we showed you. <sup>18&nbsp;</sup>Many people live like enemies of the cross of Christ. I have often told you about them, and it makes me cry to tell you about them now. <sup>19&nbsp;</sup>In the end, they will be destroyed. They do whatever their bodies want, they are proud of their shameful acts, and they think only about earthly things. <sup>20&nbsp;</sup>But our homeland is in heaven, and we are waiting for our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, to come from heaven. <sup>21&nbsp;</sup>By his power to rule all things, he will change our humble bodies and make them like his own glorious body.

            <p>
                <sup>10&nbsp;</sup>I am very happy in the Lord that you have shown your care for me again. You continued to care about me, but there was no way for you to show it. <sup>11&nbsp;</sup>I am not telling you this because I need anything. I have learned to be satisfied with the things I have and with everything that happens. <sup>12&nbsp;</sup>I know how to live when I am poor, and I know how to live when I have plenty. I have learned the secret of being happy at any time in everything that happens, when I have enough to eat and when I go hungry, when I have more than I need and when I do not have enough. <sup>13&nbsp;</sup>I can do all things through Christ, because he gives me strength.

            <p>
                <sup>14&nbsp;</sup>But it was good that you helped me when I needed it. <sup>15&nbsp;</sup>You Philippians remember when I first preached the Good News there. When I left Macedonia, you were the only church that gave me help. <sup>16&nbsp;</sup>Several times you sent me things I needed when I was in Thessalonica. <sup>17&nbsp;</sup>Really, it is not that I want to receive gifts from you, but I want you to have the good that comes from giving. <sup>18&nbsp;</sup>And now I have everything, and more. I have all I need, because Epaphroditus brought your gift to me. It is like a sweet-smelling sacrifice offered to God, who accepts that sacrifice and is pleased with it. <sup>19&nbsp;</sup>My God will use his wonderful riches in Christ Jesus to give you everything you need. <sup>20&nbsp;</sup>Glory to our God and Father forever and ever! Amen.

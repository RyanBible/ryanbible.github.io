        <h3>God&#39;s Anger Against Sinners <span class="floatcomment">What is sin?</span></h3>

        <div class="rightbox">
            <h4>How we sin</h4>

            <ol>
                <li>God made the truth about himself plain to them</li>

                <li>You can see a reflection of God's power and existence in the world</li>

                <li>They knew God but didn't thank or honour him. They damaged their mind and heart</li>

                <li>They chose statues of things rather than God</li>

                <li>God left them to it</li>

                <li>It caused bad effects in their life</li>

                <li>They lie to themselves and approve other people's lies</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p><sup>18</sup>God shows his anger from heaven. It is against all the godless and evil things people do. They are so evil that they say no to the truth. <sup>19</sup>The truth about God is plain to them. God has made it plain. <sup>20</sup>Ever since the world was created it has been possible to see the qualities of God that are not seen. I&#39;m talking about his eternal power and about the fact that he is God. Those things can be seen in what he has made. So people have no excuse for what they do.</p>

        <p><sup>21</sup>They knew God. But they didn&#39;t honor him as God. They didn&#39;t thank him. Their thinking became worthless. Their foolish hearts became dark. <sup>22</sup>They claimed to be wise. But they made fools of themselves. <sup>23</sup>They would rather have statues of gods than the glorious God who lives forever. Their statues of gods are made to look like people, birds, animals and reptiles.</p>

        <p><sup>24</sup>So God let them go. He allowed them to do what their sinful hearts wanted to. He let them commit sexual sins. They made one another&#39;s bodies impure by what they did. <sup>25</sup><mark>They chose a lie instead of the truth about God. They worshiped and served created things. They didn&#39;t worship the Creator.<span class="comment" data-comment="Summary of the paragraph"></span></mark> But he is praised forever. Amen.</p>

        <p><sup>26</sup>So God let them continue to have their shameful desires. Their women committed sexual acts that were not natural. <sup>27</sup>In the same way, the men turned away from their natural love for women. They burned with sexual desire for each other. Men did shameful things with other men. They suffered in their bodies for all the wrong things they did.</p>

        <p><sup>28</sup>They didn&#39;t think it was important to know God. So God let them continue to have evil thoughts. They did things they shouldn&#39;t do. <sup>29</sup>They are full of every kind of sin, evil and ungodliness. They want more than they need. They commit murder. They want what belongs to other people. They fight and cheat. They hate others. They say mean things about other people. <sup>30</sup>They tell lies about them. They hate God. They are rude and proud. They brag. They think of new ways to do evil. They don&#39;t obey their parents. <sup>31</sup>They do not understand. They can&#39;t be trusted. They are not loving and kind. <sup>32</sup><mark>They know that God&#39;s commands are right. They know that those who do evil things should die. But they continue to do those very things.</mark> They also approve of others who do them.</p>

        <h3>God Judges Fairly<span class="floatcomment">God judges based on your judgements</span></h3>

        <p><a class="ch">2</a>If you judge someone else, you have no excuse for it. When you judge another person, you are judging yourself. You do the same things you blame others for doing. <sup>2</sup>We know that when God judges those who do evil things, he judges fairly. <sup>3</sup>Though you are only a human being, you judge others. But you yourself do the same things. So how do you think you will escape when God judges you? <sup>4</sup>Do you disrespect God&#39;s great kindness and favor? Do you disrespect God when he is patient with you? Don&#39;t you realize that God&#39;s kindness is meant to turn you away from your sins?</p>

        <p><sup>5</sup>But you are stubborn. In your heart you are not sorry for your sins. You are storing up anger against yourself. The day of God&#39;s anger is coming. Then his way of judging fairly will be shown. <sup>6</sup>God &quot;will pay back each person in keeping with what they have done.&quot; (Psalm 62:12; Proverbs 24:12) <sup>7</sup>God will give eternal life to those who keep on doing good. They want glory, honor, and life that never ends. <sup>8</sup>But there are others who only look out for themselves. They don&#39;t accept the truth. They go astray. God will pour out his great anger on them. <sup>9</sup>There will be trouble and suffering for everyone who does evil. That is meant first for the Jews. It is also meant for the Gentiles. <sup>10</sup>But there will be glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good. That is meant first for the Jews. It is also meant for the Gentiles. <sup>11</sup>God treats everyone the same.</p>

        <div class="rightbox">
            <h4>You're judged by what you know</h4>

            <p>If you know the law you'll be judged by it. (2:12)<br>
            If you don't know the law you won't be. (2:12)<br>
            Non-jews have the law written on their hearts. God will judge them based on how they judge themselves.</p>
        </div>

        <p><sup>12</sup>Some people do not know God&#39;s law when they sin. They will not be judged by the law when they die. Others do know God&#39;s law when they sin. They will be judged by the law. <sup>13</sup>Hearing the law does not make a person right with God. People are considered to be right with God only when they obey the law. <sup>14</sup>Gentiles do not have the law. Sometimes they just naturally do what the law requires. They are a law for themselves. This is true even though they don&#39;t have the law. <sup>15</sup>They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts. The way their minds judge them proves this fact. Sometimes their thoughts find them guilty. At other times their thoughts find them not guilty. <sup>16</sup>This will happen on the day God appoints Jesus Christ to judge people&#39;s secret thoughts. That&#39;s part of my good news.</p>

        <h3>The Jews and the Law<span class="floatcomment">Being from the right background is irrelevant; you have to live it</span></h3>

        <p><sup>17</sup>Suppose you call yourself a Jew. You trust in the law. You brag that you know God. <sup>18</sup>You know what God wants. You agree with what is best because the law teaches you. <sup>19</sup>You think you know so much more than the people you teach. You think you&#39;re helping blind people. You think you are a light for those in the dark. <sup>20</sup>You think you can make foolish people wise. You act like you&#39;re teaching little children. You think that the law gives you all knowledge and truth. <sup>21</sup>You claim to teach others, but you don&#39;t even teach yourself! You preach against stealing. But you steal! <sup>22</sup>You say that people should not commit adultery. But you commit adultery! You hate statues of gods. But you rob temples! <sup>23</sup>You brag about the law. But when you break it, you rob God of his honor! <sup>24</sup>It is written, &quot;The Gentiles say evil things against God&#39;s name because of you.&quot; (Isaiah 52:5; Ezekiel 36:22)</p>

        <p><sup>25</sup>Circumcision has value if you obey the law. But if you break the law, it is just as if you hadn&#39;t been circumcised. <sup>26</sup>And sometimes those who aren&#39;t circumcised do what the law requires. Won&#39;t God accept them as if they had been circumcised? <sup>27</sup>Many are not circumcised physically, but they obey the law. They will prove that you are guilty. You are breaking the law, even though you have the written law and are circumcised.</p>

        <p><sup>28</sup>A person is not a Jew if they are a Jew only on the outside. And circumcision is more than just something done to the outside of a man&#39;s body. <sup>29</sup>No, a person is a Jew only if they are a Jew on the inside. And true circumcision means that the heart has been circumcised by the Holy Spirit. The person whose heart has been circumcised does more than obey the written law. The praise that matters for that kind of person does not come from other people. It comes from God.</p>

        <h3>God Is Faithful</h3>

        <p><a class="ch">3</a>Is there any advantage in being a Jew? Is there any value in being circumcised? <sup>2</sup>There is great value in every way! First of all, the Jews have been given the very words of God.</p>

        <p><sup>3</sup>What if some Jews were not faithful? Will the fact that they weren&#39;t faithful keep God from being faithful? <sup>4</sup>Not at all! God is true, even if every human being is a liar. It is written,</p>

        <p>&quot;You are right when you sentence me.<br>
        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; You are fair when you judge me.&quot; (Psalm 51:4)</p>

        <p><sup>5</sup>Doesn&#39;t the fact that we are wrong prove more clearly that God is right? Then what can we say? Can we say that God is not fair when he brings his anger down on us? As you can tell, I am just using human ways of thinking. <sup>6</sup>God is certainly fair! If he weren&#39;t, how could he judge the world? <sup>7</sup>Someone might argue, &quot;When I lie, it becomes clearer that God is truthful. It makes his glory shine more brightly. Why then does he find me guilty of sin?&quot; <sup>8</sup>Why not say, &quot;Let&#39;s do evil things so that good things will happen&quot;? Some people actually lie by reporting that this is what we say. They are the ones who will rightly be found guilty.</p>

        <h3>No One Is Right With God<span class="floatcomment">We've all missed the mark</span></h3>

        <p><sup>9</sup>What should we say then? Do we Jews have any advantage? Not at all! We have already claimed that Jews and Gentiles are sinners. <mark>Everyone is under the power of <span class="wordcomment" data-comment="ἁμαρτία (hamartia). Def: prop: missing the mark &#8756; in an ethical sense: guilt/a fault/failure. NT only uses ethically">sin</span></mark>. <sup>10</sup>It is written,</p>

        <blockquote>
            No one is right with God, no one at all.<br>
            <sup>11</sup>No one understands.<br>
            No one trusts in God.<br>
            <sup>12</sup>All of them have turned away.<br>
            They have all become worthless.<br>
            No one does anything good,<br>
            no one at all. (Psalms 14:1; 53:1; Ecclesiastes 7:20)<br>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <sup>13</sup>&quot;Their throats are like open graves.<br>
            With their tongues they tell lies. (Psalm 5:9)<br>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            The words from their lips are like the poison of a snake. (Psalm 140:3)<br>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <sup>14</sup>Their mouths are full of curses and bitterness. (Psalm 10:7)<br>
            <sup>15</sup>They run quickly to commit murder.<br>
            <sup>16</sup>They leave a trail of harmful actions.<br>
            <sup>17</sup>They do not know how to live in peace. (Isaiah 59:7-8)<br>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <sup>18</sup>They don't have any respect for God. (Psalm 36:1)
        </blockquote>

        <p><sup>19</sup>What the law says, it says to those who are ruled by the law. Its purpose is to shut every mouth and make the whole world accountable to God. <sup>20</sup>So no one will be considered right with God by obeying the law. Instead, the law makes us more aware of our <span class="wordcomment" data-comment="ἁμαρτία (hamartia). Def: prop: missing the mark &#8756; in an ethical sense: guilt/a fault/failure. NT only uses ethically">sin</span>.</p>

        <h3>Becoming Right With God by Faith</h3>

        <div class="rightbox">
            <h4>Getting right with God</h4>

            <p>You get right with God by trusting him/having trust in him. Your background doesn't matter (e.g. Christian or not). Everyone has sinned. Jesus paid the price to set us free.</p>
        </div>

        <p><sup>21</sup>But now God has shown us his saving power without the help of the law. But the Law and the Prophets tell us about this. <sup>22</sup> <mark class="ghigh3">We are made right with God by putting our faith in Jesus Christ</mark>. This happens to all who believe. It is no different for the Jews than for the Gentiles. <sup>23</sup><mark class="highlight3">Everyone has sinned. No one measures up to God&#39;s glory.</mark> <sup>24</sup><mark class="highlight3">The free gift of God&#39;s grace makes us right with him. Christ Jesus paid the price to set us free.</mark> <sup>25</sup>God gave Christ as a sacrifice to pay for sins through the spilling of his blood. <mark class="highlight3">So God forgives the sins of those who have faith.</mark> God did all this to prove that he does what is right. He is a God of mercy. So he did not punish for their sins the people who lived before Jesus lived. <sup>26</sup>God did all this to prove in our own time that he does what is right. <mark class="highlight3">He also makes right with himself those who believe in Jesus.</mark></p>

        <div class="rightbox">
            <h4>The Good news causes humility</h4>

            <p>In the end people are made right with God by faith, not by following the law. Everyone breaks some of the law therefore everyone has broken all of the lord. E.g. "Lord of all or not Lord at all"</p>
        </div>

        <p><sup>27</sup>So who can brag? No one! Are people saved by the law that requires them to obey? Not at all! They are saved because of the law that requires faith. <sup>28</sup><mark>We firmly believe that a person is made right with God because of their faith. They are not saved by obeying the law.</mark> <sup>29</sup>Or is God the God of Jews only? Isn&#39;t he also the God of Gentiles? Yes, he is their God too. <sup>30</sup>There is only one God. When those who are circumcised believe in him, he makes them right with himself. Suppose those who are not circumcised believe in him. Then God also will make them right with himself. <sup>31</sup>Does faith make the law useless? Not at all! We agree with the law.</p>

        <h3>Abraham&#39;s Faith Made Him Right With God</h3>

        <p><a class="ch">4</a>What should we say about these things? What did Abraham, the father of our people, discover about being right with God? <sup>2</sup>Did he become right with God because of something he did? If so, he could brag about it. But he couldn&#39;t brag to God. <sup>3</sup>What do we find in Scripture? It says, &quot;Abraham believed God. God accepted Abraham&#39;s faith, and so his faith made him right with God.&quot; (Genesis 15:6)</p>

        <p><sup>4</sup>When a person works, their pay is not considered a gift. It is owed to them. <sup>5</sup>But things are different with God. He makes ungodly people right with himself. If people trust in him, their faith is accepted even though they do not work. Their faith makes them right with God. <sup>6</sup>King David says the same thing. He tells us how blessed people are when God makes them right with himself. They are blessed because they don&#39;t have to do anything in return. David says,</p>

        <blockquote>
            <sup>7</sup>Blessed are those<br>
            whose lawless acts are forgiven.<br>
            Blessed are those<br>
            whose sins are taken away.<br>
            <sup>8</sup>Blessed is the person<br>
            whose sin the Lord never counts against them. (Psalm 32:1-2)
        </blockquote>

        <p><sup>9</sup>Is that blessing only for those who are circumcised? Or is it also for those who are not circumcised? We have been saying that God accepted Abraham&#39;s faith. So his faith made him right with God. <sup>10</sup>When did it happen? Was it after Abraham was circumcised, or before? It was before he was circumcised, not after! <sup>11</sup>He was circumcised as a sign of the covenant God had made with him. It showed that his faith had made him right with God before he was circumcised. So Abraham is the father of all believers who have not been circumcised. God accepts their faith. So their faith makes them right with him. <sup>12</sup>And Abraham is also the father of those who are circumcised and believe. So just being circumcised is not enough. Those who are circumcised must also follow the steps of our father Abraham. He had faith before he was circumcised.</p>

        <p><sup>13</sup>Abraham and his family received a promise. God promised that Abraham would receive the world. It would not come to him because he obeyed the law. It would come because of his faith, which made him right with God. <sup>14</sup>Do those who depend on the law receive the promise? If they do, faith would mean nothing. God&#39;s promise would be worthless. <sup>15</sup>The law brings God&#39;s anger. Where there is no law, the law can&#39;t be broken.</p>

        <p><sup>16</sup>The promise is based on God&#39;s grace. The promise comes by faith. All of Abraham&#39;s children will certainly receive the promise. And it is not only for those who are ruled by the law. Those who have the same faith that Abraham had are also included. He is the father of us all. <sup>17</sup>It is written, &quot;I have made you a father of many nations.&quot; (Genesis 17:5) God considers Abraham to be our father. The God that Abraham believed in gives life to the dead. Abraham&#39;s God also creates things that did not exist before.</p>

        <p><sup>18</sup>When there was no reason for hope, Abraham believed because he had hope. He became the father of many nations, exactly as God had promised. God said, &quot;That is how many children you will have.&quot; (Genesis 15:5) <sup>19</sup>Abraham did not become weak in his faith. He accepted the fact that he was past the time when he could have children. At that time Abraham was about 100 years old. He also realized that Sarah was too old to have children. <sup>20</sup>But Abraham kept believing in God&#39;s promise. He became strong in his faith. He gave glory to God. <sup>21</sup>He was absolutely sure that God had the power to do what he had promised. <sup>22</sup>That&#39;s why &quot;God accepted Abraham because he believed. So his faith made him right with God.&quot; ( Genesis 15:6) <sup>23</sup>The words &quot;God accepted Abraham&#39;s faith&quot; were written not only for Abraham. <sup>24</sup>They were written also for us. <mark>We believe in the God who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. So God will accept our faith and make us right with himself. <sup>25</sup>Jesus was handed over to die for our sins. He was raised to life in order to make us right with God.</mark></p>

        <h3>Death Through Adam, Life Through Christ</h3>

        <div class="rightbox">
            <h4>Life through Christ</h4>

            <p>One right act made people right with God. That one right act gave life to all people.</p>
        </div>

        <p><sup>12</sup>Sin entered the world because one man sinned. And death came because of sin. Everyone sinned, so death came to all people.</p>

        <p><sup>13</sup>Before the law was given, sin was in the world. This is certainly true. But people are not judged for sin when there is no law. <sup>14</sup>Death ruled from the time of Adam to the time of Moses. Death ruled even over those who did not sin as Adam did. He broke God&#39;s command. But Adam also became a pattern of the Messiah. The Messiah was the one who was going to come.</p>

        <p><sup>15</sup>God&#39;s gift can&#39;t be compared with Adam&#39;s sin. Many people died because of the sin of that one man. But it was even more sure that God&#39;s grace would also come through one man. That man is Jesus Christ. God&#39;s gift of grace was more than enough for the whole world. <sup>16</sup>The result of God&#39;s gift is different from the result of Adam&#39;s sin. That one sin brought God&#39;s judgment. But after many sins, God&#39;s gift made people right with him. <sup>17</sup>One man sinned, and death ruled over all people because of his sin. What will happen is even more sure than this. Those who receive the rich supply of God&#39;s grace will rule with Christ. They will rule in his kingdom. They have received God&#39;s gift and have been made right with him. This will happen because of what the one man, Jesus Christ, has done.</p>

        <p><sup>18</sup>So one man&#39;s sin brought guilt to all people. In the same way, one right act made people right with God. That one right act gave life to all people. <sup>19</sup>Many people were made sinners because one man did not obey. But one man did obey. That is why many people will be made right with God.</p>

        <p><sup>20</sup>The law was given so that sin would increase. But where sin increased, God&#39;s grace increased even more.<span class="comment" data-comment="The law shows you how you are missing the mark. Then you know how much grace there is"></span> <sup>21</sup>Sin ruled and brought death. But grace rules in the lives of those who are right with God. The grace of God brings eternal life. That&#39;s because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has done.</p>

        <h3>Living a New Life in Christ<span class="floatcomment">New life</span></h3>

        <div class="rightbox">
            <h4>Romans 6:1-14 - Why not miss the mark if God has already forgiven us?</h4>

            <p>Sin smells like death. If Jesus has killed death, why would you go back to it?<br>
            <br>
            Sin has no power now. Don't chose something that causes death.</p>
        </div>

        <p><a class="ch">6</a>What should we say then? Should we keep on sinning so that God&#39;s grace can increase? <sup>2</sup>Not at all! As far as sin is concerned, we are dead. So how can we keep on sinning? <sup>3</sup>All of us were baptized into Christ Jesus. Don&#39;t you know that we were baptized into his death? <sup>4</sup>By being baptized, we were buried with Christ into his death. Christ has been raised from the dead by the Father&#39;s glory. And like Christ we also can live a new life.</p>

        <p><sup>5</sup>By being baptized, we have been joined with him in a death like his. So we will certainly also be joined with him in a resurrection like his. <sup>6</sup>We know that what we used to be was nailed to the cross with him. That happened so our bodies that were ruled by sin would lose their power. So <mark>we are no longer slaves of sin</mark>. <sup>7</sup>That&#39;s because those who have died have been set free from sin.</p>

        <p><sup>8</sup>We died with Christ. So we believe that we will also live with him. <sup>9</sup>We know that Christ was raised from the dead and will never die again. Death doesn&#39;t control him anymore. <sup>10</sup>When he died, he died once and for all time. <mark>He did this to break the power of sin.</mark> Now that he lives, he lives in the power of God.</p>

        <p><sup>11</sup>In the same way, <mark>consider yourselves to be dead as far as sin is concerned</mark>. Now you believe in Christ Jesus. So consider yourselves to be alive as far as God is concerned. <sup>12</sup>So don&#39;t let sin rule your body, which is going to die. Don&#39;t obey its evil desires. <sup>13</sup>Don&#39;t give any part of yourself to serve sin. Don&#39;t let any part of yourself be used to do evil. Instead, give yourselves to God. You have been brought from death to life. So give every part of yourself to God to do what is right. <sup>14</sup>Sin will no longer control you like a master. That&#39;s because the law does not rule you. God&#39;s grace has set you free.</p>

        <h3>Slaves to Right Living</h3>

        <div class="rightbox">
            <h4>Romans 6:15-23 - Why not miss the mark if God has already forgiven us?</h4>

            <p>You used to be slaves/addicted to sin. Now you're not. Why would you go back to it?<br>
            <br>
            Sin is addicted and takes away your freedom</p>

            <ul>
                <li>If you're free to lose your temper; you'll become addicted to rage</li>

                <li>If you're free to smoke; you'll lose your freedom to be healthy</li>

                <li>If you're free to use pornography; you'll lose your freedom to healthy relationships</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p><sup>15</sup>What should we say then? Should we sin because we are not ruled by the law but by God&#39;s grace? Not at all! <sup>16</sup>Don&#39;t you know that when you give yourselves to obey someone you become that person&#39;s slave? If you are slaves of sin, then you will die. But if you are slaves who obey God, then you will live a godly life. <sup>17</sup>You used to be slaves of sin. But thank God that with your whole heart you obeyed the teachings you were given! <sup>18</sup>You have been set free from sin. You have become slaves to right living.</p>

        <p><sup>19</sup>Because you are human, you find this hard to understand. So I am using an everyday example to help you understand. You used to give yourselves to be slaves to unclean living. You were becoming more and more evil. Now give yourselves to be slaves to right living. Then you will become holy. <sup>20</sup>Once you were slaves of sin. At that time right living did not control you. <sup>21</sup>What benefit did you gain from doing the things you are now ashamed of? Those things lead to death! <sup>22</sup><mark>You have been set free from sin. God has made you his slaves. The benefit you gain leads to holy living. And the end result is eternal life.</mark> <sup>23</sup>When you sin, the pay you get is death. But God gives you the gift of eternal life. That&#39;s because of what Christ Jesus our Lord has done.</p>

        <h3>An Example From Marriage</h3>

        <p></p>

        <div class="rightbox">
            <h4>Romans 7:1-6 - Why not miss the mark if God has already forgiven us?</h4>

            <p>The question isn't why be good but why love? God loves you this much. Trust him.</p>
        </div>

        <p><a class="ch">7</a>Brothers and sisters, I am speaking to you who know the law. Don&#39;t you know that the law has authority over someone only as long as they live? <sup>2</sup>For example, by law a married woman remains married as long as her husband lives. But suppose her husband dies. Then the law that joins her to him no longer applies. <sup>3</sup>But suppose that married woman sleeps with another man while her husband is still alive. Then she is called a woman who commits adultery. But suppose her husband dies. Then she is free from that law. She is not guilty of adultery if she marries another man.</p>

        <p><sup>4</sup>My brothers and sisters, when Christ died you also died as far as the law is concerned. Then it became possible for you to belong to him. He was raised from the dead. Now our lives can be useful to God. <sup>5</sup>The power of sin used to control us. The law stirred up sinful desires in us. So the things we did resulted in death. <sup>6</sup>But now we have died to what used to control us. We have been set free from the law. Now we serve in the new way of the Holy Spirit. We no longer serve in the old way of the written law.</p>

        <h3>The Law and Sin</h3>

        <p><sup>7</sup>What should we say then? That the law is sinful? Not at all! Yet I wouldn&#39;t have known what sin was unless the law had told me. The law says, &quot;Do not want what belongs to other people.&quot; (Exodus 20:17; Deuteronomy 5:21) If the law hadn&#39;t said that, I would not have known what it was like to want what belongs to others. <sup>8</sup>But the commandment gave sin an opportunity. Sin caused me to want all kinds of things that belong to others. A person can&#39;t sin by breaking a law if that law doesn&#39;t exist. <sup>9</sup>Before I knew about the law, I was alive. But then the commandment came. Sin came to life, and I died. <sup>10</sup>I found that the commandment that was supposed to bring life actually brought death. <sup>11</sup>When the commandment gave sin the opportunity, sin tricked me. It used the commandment to put me to death. <sup>12</sup><mark>So the law is holy. The commandment also is holy and right and good.</mark></p>

        <p><sup>13</sup>Did what is good cause me to die? Not at all! Sin had to be recognized for what it really is. So it used what is good to bring about my death. Because of the commandment, sin became totally sinful.</p>

        <p><sup>14</sup>We know that the law is holy. But I am not. I have been sold to be a slave of sin. <sup>15</sup>I don&#39;t understand what I do. I don&#39;t do what I want to do. Instead, I do what I hate to do. <sup>16</sup>I do what I don&#39;t want to do. So I agree that the law is good. <sup>17</sup>As it is, I am no longer the one who does these things. It is sin living in me that does them. <sup>18</sup>I know there is nothing good in my desires controlled by sin. I want to do what is good, but I can&#39;t. <sup>19</sup>I don&#39;t do the good things I want to do. I keep on doing the evil things I don&#39;t want to do. <sup>20</sup>I do what I don&#39;t want to do. But I am not really the one who is doing it. It is sin living in me that does it.</p>

        <div class="rightbox">
            <h4>The fight</h4>

            <p>There is good and evil in us. The ends of us our fighting and struggling. Who will save me from this inner evil? I give thanks to God who saves me</p>
        </div>

        <p><sup>21</sup>Here is the law I find working in me. When I want to do good, evil is right there with me. <sup>22</sup>Deep inside me I find joy in God&#39;s law. <sup>23</sup>But I see another law working in me. It fights against the law of my mind. It makes me a prisoner of the law of sin. That law controls me. <sup>24</sup>What a terrible failure I am! Who will save me from this sin that brings death to my body? <sup>25</sup>I give thanks to God who saves me. He saves me through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

        <p>So in my mind I am a slave to God&#39;s law. But sin controls my desires. So I am a slave to the law of sin.</p>

        <h3>The Holy Spirit Gives Life</h3>

        <p><a class="ch">8</a><mark>Those who belong to Christ Jesus are no longer under God&#39;s judgment. <sup>2</sup>Because of what Christ Jesus has done, you are free.</mark> You are now controlled by the law of the Holy Spirit who gives you life. The law of the Spirit frees you from the law of sin that brings death. <sup>3</sup>The written law was made weak by the power of sin. But God did what the written law could not do. He made his Son to be like those who live under the power of sin. God sent him to be an offering for sin. Jesus suffered God&#39;s judgment against our sin. <sup>4</sup><mark>Jesus does for us everything the holy law requires. The power of sin should no longer control the way we live. The Holy Spirit should control the way we live.</mark></p>

        <p><sup>5</sup>So don&#39;t live under the control of sin. If you do, you will think about what sin wants. <mark>Live under the control of the Holy Spirit.</mark> If you do, you will think about what the Spirit wants. <sup>6</sup>The thoughts of a person ruled by sin bring death. But the mind ruled by the Spirit brings life and peace. <sup>7</sup>The mind ruled by the power of sin is at war with God. It does not obey God&#39;s law. It can&#39;t. <sup>8</sup>Those who are under the power of sin can&#39;t please God.</p>

        <p><sup>9</sup>But you are not ruled by the power of sin. Instead, the Holy Spirit rules over you. This is true if the Spirit of God lives in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to Christ. <sup>10</sup>If Christ lives in you, you will live. Though your body will die because of sin, the Spirit gives you life. The Spirit does this because you have been made right with God. <sup>11</sup>The Spirit of the God who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you. So the God who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your bodies. He will do this because of his Spirit who lives in you.</p>

        <p><sup>12</sup><mark>Brothers and sisters, we have a duty. Our duty is not to live under the power of sin.</mark> <sup>13</sup>If you live under the power of sin, you will die. But by the Spirit&#39;s power you can put to death the sins you commit. Then you will live.</p>

        <p><sup>14</sup><mark>Those who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God.</mark> <sup>15</sup>The Spirit you received doesn&#39;t make you slaves. Otherwise you would live in fear again. Instead, the Holy Spirit you received made you God&#39;s adopted child. By the Spirit&#39;s power we call God Abba. Abba means Father. <sup>16</sup>The Spirit himself joins with our spirits. Together they tell us that we are God&#39;s children. <sup>17</sup>As his children, we will receive all that he has for us. We will share what Christ receives. But we must share in his sufferings if we want to share in his glory.</p>

        <h3>Suffering Now and Glory in the Future</h3>

        <p><sup>18</sup>What we are suffering now is nothing compared with our future glory. <sup>19</sup>Everything God created looks forward to the future. That will be the time when his children appear in their full and final glory. <sup>20</sup>The created world was held back from fulfilling its purpose. But this was not the result of its own choice. It was planned that way by the one who held it back. God planned <sup>21</sup>to set the created world free. He didn&#39;t want it to rot away. Instead, God wanted it to have the same freedom and glory that his children have.</p>

        <p><sup>22</sup>We know that all that God created has been groaning. It is in pain as if it were giving birth to a child. The created world continues to groan even now. <sup>23</sup>And that&#39;s not all. We have the Holy Spirit as the promise of future blessing. But we also groan inside ourselves. We do this as we look forward to the time when God adopts us as full members of his family. Then he will give us everything he has for us. He will raise our bodies and give glory to them. <sup>24</sup>That&#39;s the hope we had when we were saved. But hope that can be seen is no hope at all. Who hopes for what they already have? <sup>25</sup>We hope for what we don&#39;t have yet. So we are patient as we wait for it.</p>

        <p><sup>26</sup>In the same way, <mark>the Holy Spirit helps us when we are weak. We don&#39;t know what we should pray for. But the Spirit himself prays for us.</mark> He prays through groans too deep for words. <sup>27</sup>God, who looks into our hearts, knows the mind of the Spirit. And the Spirit prays for God&#39;s people just as God wants him to pray.</p>

        <p><sup>28</sup><mark>We know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him.</mark> He appointed them to be saved in keeping with his purpose. <sup>29</sup>God planned that those he had chosen would become like his Son. In that way, Christ will be the first and most honored among many brothers and sisters. <sup>30</sup>And those God has planned for, he has also appointed to be saved. Those he has appointed, he has made right with himself. To those he has made right with himself, he has given his glory.</p>

        <h3>We Are More Than Winners</h3>

        <p><sup>31</sup><mark>What should we say then? Since God is on our side, who can be against us?</mark> <sup>32</sup>God did not spare his own Son. He gave him up for us all. Then won&#39;t he also freely give us everything else? <sup>33</sup>Who can bring any charge against God&#39;s chosen ones? God makes us right with himself. <sup>34</sup>Then who can sentence us to death? No one. Christ Jesus is at the right hand of God and is also praying for us. He died. More than that, he was raised to life. <sup>35</sup>Who can separate us from Christ&#39;s love? Can trouble or hard times or harm or hunger? Can nakedness or danger or war? <sup>36</sup>It is written,</p>

        <blockquote>
            Because of you, we face death all day long.<br>
            We are considered as sheep to be killed.(Psalm 44:22)
        </blockquote>

        <p><sup>37</sup>No! In all these things we are more than winners! We owe it all to Christ, who has loved us. <sup>38</sup>I am absolutely sure that not even death or life can separate us from God&#39;s love. Not even angels or demons, the present or the future, or any powers can separate us. <sup>39</sup>Not even the highest places or the lowest, or anything else in all creation can separate us. Nothing at all can ever separate us from God&#39;s love. That&#39;s because of what Christ Jesus our Lord has done.</p>

        <h3>God and the Jewish People</h3>

        <p><a class="ch">9</a>I am in Christ, and I am telling you the truth; I do not lie. My conscience is ruled by the Holy Spirit, and it tells me I am not lying. <sup>2</sup>I have great sorrow and always feel much sadness. <sup>3</sup>I wish I could help my Jewish brothers and sisters, my people. I would even wish that I were cursed and cut off from Christ if that would help them. <sup>4</sup>They are the people of Israel, God’s chosen children. They have seen the glory of God, and they have the agreements that God made between himself and his people. God gave them the law of Moses and the right way of worship and his promises. <sup>5</sup>They are the descendants of our great ancestors, and they are the earthly family into which Christ was born, who is God over all. Praise him forever! Amen.</p>

        <p></p>

        <p><sup>6</sup>It is not that God failed to keep his promise to them. But only some of the people of Israel are truly God’s people, <sup>7</sup>and only some of Abraham’s descendants are true children of Abraham. But God said to Abraham: “The descendants I promised you will be from Isaac.” <sup>8</sup>This means that not all of Abraham’s descendants are God’s true children. Abraham’s true children are those who become God’s children because of the promise God made to Abraham. <sup>9</sup>God’s promise to Abraham was this: “At the right time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.” <sup>10</sup>And that is not all. Rebekah’s sons had the same father, our father Isaac. <sup>11-12</sup>But before the two boys were born, God told Rebekah, “The older will serve the younger.” This was before the boys had done anything good or bad. God said this so that the one chosen would be chosen because of God’s own plan. He was chosen because he was the one God wanted to call, not because of anything he did. <sup>13</sup>As the Scripture says, “I loved Jacob, but I hated Esau.”</p>

        <p><sup>14</sup>So what should we say about this? Is God unfair? In no way. <sup>15</sup>God said to Moses, “I will show kindness to anyone to whom I want to show kindness, and I will show mercy to anyone to whom I want to show mercy.” <sup>16</sup>So God will choose the one to whom he decides to show mercy; his choice does not depend on what people want or try to do. <sup>17</sup>The Scripture says to the king of Egypt: “I made you king for this reason: to show my power in you so that my name will be talked about in all the earth.” <sup>18</sup>So God shows mercy where he wants to show mercy, and he makes stubborn the people he wants to make stubborn.</p>

        <p><sup>19</sup>So one of you will ask me: “Then why does God blame us for our sins? Who can fight his will?” <sup>20</sup>You are only human, and human beings have no right to question God. An object should not ask the person who made it, “Why did you make me like this?” <sup>21</sup>The potter can make anything he wants to make. He can use the same clay to make one thing for special use and another thing for daily use.</p>

        <p><sup>22</sup>It is the same way with God. He wanted to show his anger and to let people see his power. But he patiently stayed with those people he was angry with—people who were made ready to be destroyed. <sup>23</sup>He waited with patience so that he could make known his rich glory to the people who receive his mercy. He has prepared these people to have his glory, <sup>24</sup>and we are those people whom God called. He called us not from the Jews only but also from those who are not Jews. <sup>25</sup>As the Scripture says in Hosea:</p>

        <p>“I will say, ‘You are my people’&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to those I had called ‘not my people.’And I will show my love to those people I did not love.” Hosea 2:1, 23<sup>26</sup>“They were called,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘You are not my people,’but later they will be called&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘children of the living God.’” Hosea 1:10</p>

        <p><sup>27</sup>And Isaiah cries out about Israel:</p>

        <blockquote>
            The people of Israel are many,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like the grains of sand by the sea.But only a few of them will be saved,<sup>28</sup>because the Lord will quickly and completely punish the people on the earth. (Isaiah 10:22–23)
        </blockquote>

        <p><sup>29</sup>It is as Isaiah said:</p>

        <blockquote>
            The Lord All-Powerful&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allowed a few of our descendants to live.Otherwise we would have been completely destroyed like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. (Isaiah 1:9)
        </blockquote>

        <p><sup>30</sup>So what does all this mean? Those who are not Jews were not trying to make themselves right with God, but they were made right with God because of their faith. <sup>31</sup>The people of Israel tried to follow a law to make themselves right with God. But they did not succeed, <sup>32</sup>because they tried to make themselves right by the things they did instead of trusting in God to make them right. They stumbled over the stone that causes people to stumble. <sup>33</sup>As it is written in the Scripture:</p>

        <blockquote>
            I will put in Jerusalem a stone that causes people to stumble, a rock that makes them fall. Anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed. (Isaiah 8:14; 28:16)
        </blockquote>

        <p><a class="ch">10</a>Brothers and sisters, the thing I want most is for all the Jews to be saved. That is my prayer to God. <sup>2</sup>I can say this about them: They really try to follow God, but they do not know the right way. <sup>3</sup>Because they did not know the way that God makes people right with him, they tried to make themselves right in their own way. So they did not accept God’s way of making people right. <sup>4</sup>Christ ended the law so that everyone who believes in him may be right with God.</p>

        <p></p>

        <p><sup>5</sup>Moses writes about being made right by following the law. He says, “A person who obeys these things will live because of them.” <sup>6</sup>But this is what the Scripture says about being made right through faith: “Don’t say to yourself, ‘Who will go up into heaven?’” (That means, “Who will go up to heaven and bring Christ down to earth?”) <sup>7</sup>“And do not say, ‘Who will go down into the world below?’” (That means, “Who will go down and bring Christ up from the dead?”) <sup>8</sup>This is what the Scripture says: “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart.” That is the teaching of faith that we are telling. <sup>9</sup>If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and if you believe in your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead, you will be saved. <sup>10</sup>We believe with our hearts, and so we are made right with God. And we declare with our mouths that we believe, and so we are saved. <sup>11</sup>As the Scripture says, “Anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed.” <sup>12</sup>That Scripture says “anyone” because there is no difference between those who are Jews and those who are not. The same Lord is the Lord of all and gives many blessings to all who trust in him, <sup>13</sup>as the Scripture says, “Anyone who calls on the Lord will be saved.”</p>

        <p><sup>14</sup><mark>But before people can ask the Lord for help, they must believe in him; and before they can believe in him, they must hear about him; and for them to hear about the Lord, someone must tell them;</mark> <sup>15</sup>and before someone can go and tell them, that person must be sent. It is written, “How beautiful is the person who comes to bring good news.” <sup>16</sup>But not all the Jews accepted the good news. Isaiah said, “Lord, who believed what we told them?” <sup>17</sup>So faith comes from hearing the Good News, and people hear the Good News when someone tells them about Christ.</p>

        <p><sup>18</sup>But I ask: Didn’t people hear the Good News? Yes, they heard—as the Scripture says:</p>

        <blockquote>
            Their message went out through all the world; their words go everywhere on earth. (Psalm 19:4)
        </blockquote>

        <p><sup>19</sup>Again I ask: Didn’t the people of Israel understand? Yes, they did understand. First, Moses says:</p>

        <blockquote>
            I will use those who are not a nation to make you jealous. I will use a nation that does not understand to make you angry. (Deuteronomy 32:21)
        </blockquote>

        <p><sup>20</sup>Then Isaiah is bold enough to say:</p>

        <blockquote>
            I was found by those who were not asking me for help.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made myself known to people who were not looking for me. (Isaiah 65:1)
        </blockquote>

        <p><sup>21</sup>But about Israel God says,</p>

        <blockquote>
            All day long I stood ready to accept people who disobey and are stubborn.” (Isaiah 65:2)
        </blockquote>

        <h3>God Shows Mercy to All People</h3>

        <p><a class="ch">11</a>So I ask: Did God throw out his people? No! I myself am an Israelite from the family of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. <sup>2</sup>God chose the Israelites to be his people before they were born, and he has not thrown his people out. Surely you know what the Scripture says about Elijah, how he prayed to God against the people of Israel. <sup>3</sup>“Lord,” he said, “they have killed your prophets, and they have destroyed your altars. I am the only prophet left, and now they are trying to kill me, too.” <sup>4</sup>But what answer did God give Elijah? He said, “But I have left seven thousand people in Israel who have never bowed down before Baal.” <sup>5</sup>It is the same now. There are a few people that God has chosen by his grace. <sup>6</sup>And if he chose them by grace, it is not for the things they have done. If they could be made God’s people by what they did, God’s gift of grace would not really be a gift.</p>

        <p></p>

        <p><sup>7</sup>So this is what has happened: Although the Israelites tried to be right with God, they did not succeed, but the ones God chose did become right with him. The others were made stubborn and refused to listen to God. <sup>8</sup>As it is written in the Scriptures:</p>

        <blockquote>
            God gave the people a dull mind so they could not understand. (Isaiah 29:10)
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            He closed their eyes so they could not see and their ears so they could not hear.This continues until today. (Deuteronomy 29:4)
        </blockquote>

        <p><sup>9</sup>And David says:</p>

        <blockquote>
            Let their own feasts trap them and cause their ruin; let their feasts cause them to stumble and be paid back.<sup>10</sup>Let their eyes be closed so they cannot see and their backs be forever weak from troubles. (Psalm 69:22–23)
        </blockquote>

        <p><sup>11</sup>So I ask: When the Jews fell, did that fall destroy them? No! But their failure brought salvation to those who are not Jews, in order to make the Jews jealous. <sup>12</sup>The Jews’ failure brought rich blessings for the world, and the Jews’ loss brought rich blessings for the non-Jewish people. So surely the world will receive much richer blessings when enough Jews become the kind of people God wants.</p>

        <p><sup>13</sup>Now I am speaking to you who are not Jews. I am an apostle to those who are not Jews, and since I have that work, I will make the most of it. <sup>14</sup>I hope I can make my own people jealous and, in that way, help some of them to be saved. <sup>15</sup>When God turned away from the Jews, he became friends with other people in the world. So when God accepts the Jews, surely that will bring them life after death.</p>

        <p><sup>16</sup>If the first piece of bread is offered to God, then the whole loaf is made holy. If the roots of a tree are holy, then the tree’s branches are holy too.</p>

        <p><sup>17</sup>It is as if some of the branches from an olive tree have been broken off. You non-Jewish people are like the branch of a wild olive tree that has been joined to that first tree. You now share the strength and life of the first tree, the Jews. <sup>18</sup>So do not brag about those branches that were broken off. If you brag, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you. <sup>19</sup>You will say, “Branches were broken off so that I could be joined to their tree.” <sup>20</sup>That is true. But those branches were broken off because they did not believe, and you continue to be part of the tree only because you believe. Do not be proud, but be afraid. <sup>21</sup>If God did not let the natural branches of that tree stay, then he will not let you stay if you don’t believe.</p>

        <p><sup>22</sup>So you see that God is kind and also very strict. He punishes those who stop following him. But God is kind to you, if you continue following in his kindness. If you do not, you will be cut off from the tree. <sup>23</sup>And if the Jews will believe in God again, he will accept them back. God is able to put them back where they were. <sup>24</sup>It is not natural for a wild branch to be part of a good tree. And you who are not Jews are like a branch cut from a wild olive tree and joined to a good olive tree. But since those Jews are like a branch that grew from the good tree, surely they can be joined to their own tree again.</p>

        <p><sup>25</sup>I want you to understand this secret, brothers and sisters, so you will understand that you do not know everything: Part of Israel has been made stubborn, but that will change when many who are not Jews have come to God. <sup>26</sup>And that is how all Israel will be saved. It is written in the Scriptures:</p>

        <blockquote>
            The Savior will come from Jerusalem he will take away all evil from the family of Jacob.<sup>27</sup>And I will make this agreement with those people when I take away their sins. (Isaiah 59:20–21; 27:9)
        </blockquote>

        <p><sup>28</sup>The Jews refuse to accept the Good News, so they are God’s enemies. This has happened to help you who are not Jews. But the Jews are still God’s chosen people, and he loves them very much because of the promises he made to their ancestors. <sup>29</sup>God never changes his mind about the people he calls and the things he gives them. <sup>30</sup>At one time you refused to obey God. But now you have received mercy, because those people refused to obey. <sup>31</sup>And now the Jews refuse to obey, because God showed mercy to you. But this happened so that they also can receive mercy from him. <sup>32</sup>God has given all people over to their stubborn ways so that he can show mercy to all.</p>

        <h3>Praise to God</h3>

        <p><sup>33</sup>Yes, God’s riches are very great, and his wisdom and knowledge have no end! No one can explain the things God decides or understand his ways. <sup>34</sup>As the Scripture says,</p>

        <blockquote>
            Who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been able to give him advice?” (Isaiah 40:13)
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <sup>35</sup>No one has ever given God anything that he must pay back.” (Job 41:11)
        </blockquote>

        <p><sup>36</sup>Yes, God made all things, and everything continues through him and for him. To him be the glory forever! Amen.</p>

        <h3>Give Your Lives to God</h3>

        <p><a class="ch">12</a>So brothers and sisters, since God has shown us great mercy, I beg you to offer your lives as a living sacrifice to him. Your offering must be only for God and pleasing to him, which is the spiritual way for you to worship. <sup>2</sup>Do not be shaped by this world; instead be changed within by a new way of thinking. Then you will be able to decide what God wants for you; you will know what is good and pleasing to him and what is perfect. <sup>3</sup>Because God has given me a special gift, I have something to say to everyone among you. Do not think you are better than you are. You must decide what you really are by the amount of faith God has given you. <sup>4</sup>Each one of us has a body with many parts, and these parts all have different uses. <sup>5</sup>In the same way, we are many, but in Christ we are all one body. Each one is a part of that body, and each part belongs to all the other parts. <sup>6</sup>We all have different gifts, each of which came because of the grace God gave us. The person who has the gift of prophecy should use that gift in agreement with the faith. <sup>7</sup>Anyone who has the gift of serving should serve. Anyone who has the gift of teaching should teach. <sup>8</sup>Whoever has the gift of encouraging others should encourage. Whoever has the gift of giving to others should give freely. Anyone who has the gift of being a leader should try hard when he leads. Whoever has the gift of showing mercy to others should do so with joy.</p>

        <p></p>

        <p><sup>9</sup>Your love must be real. Hate what is evil, and hold on to what is good. <sup>10</sup>Love each other like brothers and sisters. Give each other more honor than you want for yourselves. <sup>11</sup>Do not be lazy but work hard, serving the Lord with all your heart. <sup>12</sup>Be joyful because you have hope. Be patient when trouble comes, and pray at all times. <sup>13</sup>Share with God’s people who need help. Bring strangers in need into your homes.</p>

        <p><sup>14</sup>Wish good for those who harm you; wish them well and do not curse them. <sup>15</sup>Be happy with those who are happy, and be sad with those who are sad. <sup>16</sup>Live in peace with each other. Do not be proud, but make friends with those who seem unimportant. Do not think how smart you are.</p>

        <p><sup>17</sup>If someone does wrong to you, do not pay him back by doing wrong to him. Try to do what everyone thinks is right. <sup>18</sup>Do your best to live in peace with everyone. <sup>19</sup>My friends, do not try to punish others when they wrong you, but wait for God to punish them with his anger. It is written: “I will punish those who do wrong; I will repay them,” says the Lord. <sup>20</sup>But you should do this:</p>

        <blockquote>
            If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink. Doing this will be like pouring burning coals on his head. (Proverbs 25:21–22)
        </blockquote>

        <p><sup>21</sup>Do not let evil defeat you, but defeat evil by doing good.</p>

        <h3>Christians Should Obey the Law</h3>

        <p><a class="ch">13</a>All of you must yield to the government rulers. No one rules unless God has given him the power to rule, and no one rules now without that power from God. <sup>2</sup>So those who are against the government are really against what God has commanded. And they will bring punishment on themselves. <sup>3</sup>Those who do right do not have to fear the rulers; only those who do wrong fear them. Do you want to be unafraid of the rulers? Then do what is right, and they will praise you. <sup>4</sup>The ruler is God’s servant to help you. But if you do wrong, then be afraid. He has the power to punish; he is God’s servant to punish those who do wrong. <sup>5</sup>So you must yield to the government, not only because you might be punished, but because you know it is right.</p>

        <p></p>

        <p><sup>6</sup>This is also why you pay taxes. Rulers are working for God and give their time to their work. <sup>7</sup>Pay everyone, then, what you owe. If you owe any kind of tax, pay it. Show respect and honor to them all.</p>

        <h3>Loving Others</h3>

        <p><sup>8</sup>Do not owe people anything, except always owe love to each other, because the person who loves others has obeyed all the law. <sup>9</sup>The law says, “You must not be guilty of adultery. You must not murder anyone. You must not steal. You must not want to take your neighbor’s things.” All these commands and all others are really only one rule: “Love your neighbor as you love yourself.” <sup>10</sup>Love never hurts a neighbor, so loving is obeying all the law.</p>

        <p><sup>11</sup>Do this because we live in an important time. It is now time for you to wake up from your sleep, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. <sup>12</sup>The “night” is almost finished, and the “day” is almost here. So we should stop doing things that belong to darkness and take up the weapons used for fighting in the light. <sup>13</sup>Let us live in a right way, like people who belong to the day. We should not have wild parties or get drunk. There should be no sexual sins of any kind, no fighting or jealousy. <sup>14</sup>But clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ and forget about satisfying your sinful self.</p>

        <h3>Do Not Criticize Other People</h3>

        <p><a class="ch">14</a>Accept into your group someone who is weak in faith, and do not argue about opinions. <sup>2</sup>One person believes it is right to eat all kinds of food.But another, who is weak, believes it is right to eat only vegetables. <sup>3</sup>The one who knows that it is right to eat any kind of food must not reject the one who eats only vegetables. And the person who eats only vegetables must not think that the one who eats all foods is wrong, because God has accepted that person. <sup>4</sup>You cannot judge another person’s servant. The master decides if the servant is doing well or not. And the Lord’s servant will do well because the Lord helps him do well.</p>

        <p></p>

        <p><sup>5</sup>Some think that one day is more important than another, and others think that every day is the same. Let all be sure in their own mind. <sup>6</sup>Those who think one day is more important than other days are doing that for the Lord. And those who eat all kinds of food are doing that for the Lord, and they give thanks to God. Others who refuse to eat some foods do that for the Lord, and they give thanks to God. <sup>7</sup>We do not live or die for ourselves. <sup>8</sup>If we live, we are living for the Lord, and if we die, we are dying for the Lord. So living or dying, we belong to the Lord.</p>

        <p><sup>9</sup>The reason Christ died and rose from the dead to live again was so he would be Lord over both the dead and the living. <sup>10</sup>So why do you judge your brothers or sisters in Christ? And why do you think you are better than they are? We will all stand before God to be judged, <sup>11</sup>because it is written in the Scriptures:</p>

        <blockquote>
            ‘As surely as I live,’ says the Lord, ‘Everyone will bow before me; everyone will say that I am God.’ (Isaiah 45:23)
        </blockquote>

        <p><sup>12</sup>So each of us will have to answer to God.</p>

        <h3>Do Not Cause Others to Sin</h3>

        <p><sup>13</sup>For that reason we should stop judging each other. We must make up our minds not to do anything that will make another Christian sin. <sup>14</sup>I am in the Lord Jesus, and I know that there is no food that is wrong to eat. But if a person believes something is wrong, that thing is wrong for him. <sup>15</sup>If you hurt your brother’s or sister’s faith because of something you eat, you are not really following the way of love. Do not destroy someone’s faith by eating food he thinks is wrong, because Christ died for him. <sup>16</sup>Do not allow what you think is good to become what others say is evil. <sup>17</sup>In the kingdom of God, eating and drinking are not important. The important things are living right with God, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. <sup>18</sup>Anyone who serves Christ by living this way is pleasing God and will be accepted by other people.</p>

        <p><sup>19</sup>So let us try to do what makes peace and helps one another. <sup>20</sup>Do not let the eating of food destroy the work of God. All foods are all right to eat, but it is wrong to eat food that causes someone else to sin. <sup>21</sup>It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that will cause your brother or sister to sin.</p>

        <p><sup>22</sup>Your beliefs about these things should be kept secret between you and God. People are happy if they can do what they think is right without feeling guilty. <sup>23</sup>But those who eat something without being sure it is right are wrong because they did not believe it was right. Anything that is done without believing it is right is a sin.</p>

        <p><a class="ch">15</a>We who are strong in faith should help the weak with their weaknesses, and not please only ourselves. <sup>2</sup>Let each of us please our neighbors for their good, to help them be stronger in faith. <sup>3</sup>Even Christ did not live to please himself. It was as the Scriptures said: “When people insult you, it hurts me.” <sup>4</sup>Everything that was written in the past was written to teach us. The Scriptures give us patience and encouragement so that we can have hope. <sup>5</sup>May the patience and encouragement that come from God allow you to live in harmony with each other the way Christ Jesus wants. <sup>6</sup>Then you will all be joined together, and you will give glory to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. <sup>7</sup>Christ accepted you, so you should accept each other, which will bring glory to God. <sup>8</sup>I tell you that Christ became a servant of the Jews to show that God’s promises to the Jewish ancestors are true. <sup>9</sup>And he also did this so that those who are not Jews could give glory to God for the mercy he gives to them. It is written in the Scriptures:</p>

        <p></p>

        <blockquote>
            So I will praise you among the non-Jewish people. I will sing praises to your name. (Psalm 18:49)
        </blockquote>

        <p><sup>10</sup>The Scripture also says,</p>

        <blockquote>
            Be happy, you who are not Jews, together with his people. (Deuteronomy 32:43)
        </blockquote>

        <p><sup>11</sup>Again the Scripture says,</p>

        <blockquote>
            All you who are not Jews, praise the Lord. All you people, sing praises to him. (Psalm 117:1)
        </blockquote>

        <p><sup>12</sup>And Isaiah says,</p>

        <blockquote>
            A new king will come from the family of Jesse.He will come to rule over the non-Jewish people,and they will have hope because of him. (Isaiah 11:10)
        </blockquote>

        <p><sup>13</sup>I pray that the God who gives hope will fill you with much joy and peace while you trust in him. Then your hope will overflow by the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>

        <h3>Paul Talks About His Work</h3>

        <p><sup>14</sup>My brothers and sisters, I am sure that you are full of goodness. I know that you have all the knowledge you need and that you are able to teach each other. <sup>15</sup>But I have written to you very openly about some things I wanted you to remember. I did this because God gave me this special gift: <sup>16</sup>to be a minister of Christ Jesus to those who are not Jews. I served God by teaching his Good News, so that the non-Jewish people could be an offering that God would accept—an offering made holy by the Holy Spirit.</p>

        <p><sup>17</sup>So I am proud of what I have done for God in Christ Jesus. <sup>18</sup>I will not talk about anything except what Christ has done through me in leading those who are not Jews to obey God. They have obeyed God because of what I have said and done, <sup>19</sup>because of the power of miracles and the great things they saw, and because of the power of the Holy Spirit. I preached the Good News from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, and so I have finished that part of my work. <sup>20</sup>I always want to preach the Good News in places where people have never heard of Christ, because I do not want to build on the work someone else has already started. <sup>21</sup>But it is written in the Scriptures:</p>

        <blockquote>
            Those who were not told about him will see, and those who have not heard about him will understand. (Isaiah 52:15)
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Paul’s Plan to Visit Rome</h3>

        <p><sup>22</sup>This is the reason I was stopped many times from coming to you. <sup>23</sup>Now I have finished my work here. Since for many years I have wanted to come to you, <sup>24</sup>I hope to visit you on my way to Spain. After I enjoy being with you for a while, I hope you can help me on my trip. <sup>25</sup>Now I am going to Jerusalem to help God’s people. <sup>26</sup>The believers in Macedonia and Southern Greece were happy to give their money to help the poor among God’s people at Jerusalem. <sup>27</sup>They were happy to do this, and really they owe it to them. These who are not Jews have shared in the Jews’ spiritual blessings, so they should use their material possessions to help the Jews. <sup>28</sup>After I am sure the poor in Jerusalem get the money that has been given for them, I will leave for Spain and stop and visit you. <sup>29</sup>I know that when I come to you I will bring Christ’s full blessing.</p>

        <p><sup>30</sup>Brothers and sisters, I beg you to help me in my work by praying to God for me. Do this because of our Lord Jesus and the love that the Holy Spirit gives us. <sup>31</sup>Pray that I will be saved from the nonbelievers in Judea and that this help I bring to Jerusalem will please God’s people there. <sup>32</sup>Then, if God wants me to, I will come to you with joy, and together you and I will have a time of rest. <sup>33</sup>The God who gives peace be with you all. Amen.</p>

        <h3>Greetings to the Christians</h3>

        <p><a class="ch">16</a>I recommend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a helper in the church in Cenchrea. <sup>2</sup>I ask you to accept her in the Lord in the way God’s people should. Help her with anything she needs, because she has helped me and many other people also.</p>

        <p></p>

        <p><sup>3</sup>Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila, who work together with me in Christ Jesus <sup>4</sup>and who risked their own lives to save my life. I am thankful to them, and all the non-Jewish churches are thankful as well. <sup>5</sup>Also, greet for me the church that meets at their house.</p>

        <p>Greetings to my dear friend Epenetus, who was the first person in Asia to follow Christ. <sup>6</sup>Greetings to Mary, who worked very hard for you. <sup>7</sup>Greetings to Andronicus and Junia, my relatives, who were in prison with me. They are very important apostles. They were believers in Christ before I was. <sup>8</sup>Greetings to Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord. <sup>9</sup>Greetings to Urbanus, a worker together with me for Christ. And greetings to my dear friend Stachys. <sup>10</sup>Greetings to Apelles, who was tested and proved that he truly loves Christ. Greetings to all those who are in the family of Aristobulus. <sup>11</sup>Greetings to Herodion, my fellow citizen. Greetings to all those in the family of Narcissus who belong to the Lord. <sup>12</sup>Greetings to Tryphena and Tryphosa, women who work very hard for the Lord. Greetings to my dear friend Persis, who also has worked very hard for the Lord. <sup>13</sup>Greetings to Rufus, who is a special person in the Lord, and to his mother, who has been like a mother to me also. <sup>14</sup>Greetings to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and all the brothers and sisters who are with them. <sup>15</sup>Greetings to Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and to all God’s people with them. <sup>16</sup>Greet each other with a holy kiss. All of Christ’s churches send greetings to you.</p>

        <p><sup>17</sup>Brothers and sisters, I ask you to look out for those who cause people to be against each other and who upset other people’s faith. They are against the true teaching you learned, so stay away from them. <sup>18</sup>Such people are not serving our Lord Christ but are only doing what pleases themselves. They use fancy talk and fine words to fool the minds of those who do not know about evil. <sup>19</sup>All the believers have heard that you obey, so I am very happy because of you. But I want you to be wise in what is good and innocent in what is evil.</p>

        <p><sup>20</sup>The God who brings peace will soon defeat Satan and give you power over him.</p>

        <p>The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.</p>

        <p><sup>21</sup>Timothy, a worker together with me, sends greetings, as well as Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my relatives.</p>

        <p><sup>22</sup>I am Tertius, and I am writing this letter from Paul. I send greetings to you in the Lord.</p>

        <p><sup>23</sup>Gaius is letting me and the whole church here use his home. He also sends greetings to you, as do Erastus, the city treasurer, and our brother Quartus. [<sup>24</sup>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.]</p>

        <p><sup>25</sup>Glory to God who can make you strong in faith by the Good News that I tell people and by the message about Jesus Christ. The message about Christ is the secret that was hidden for long ages past but is now made known. <sup>26</sup>It has been made clear through the writings of the prophets. And by the command of the eternal God it is made known to all nations that they might believe and obey.</p>

        <p><sup>27</sup>To the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen.</p>

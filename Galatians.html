	<p><a class="ch">1</a>From Paul, an apostle. I was not chosen to be an apostle by human beings, nor was I sent from human beings. I was made an apostle through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Jesus from the dead. <sup>2&nbsp;</sup>This letter is also from all those of God’s family who are with me.<p></p>

	<p>To the churches in Galatia:</p>

	<p><sup>3&nbsp;</sup>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. <sup>4&nbsp;</sup>Jesus gave himself for our sins to free us from this evil world we live in, as God the Father planned. <sup>5&nbsp;</sup>The glory belongs to God forever and ever. Amen.</p>

	<h3>The Only Good News</h3>

	<p><sup>6&nbsp;</sup>God, by his grace through Christ, called you to become his people. So I am amazed that you are turning away so quickly and believing something different than the Good News. <sup>7&nbsp;</sup>Really, there is no other Good News. But some people are confusing you; they want to change the Good News of Christ. <sup>8&nbsp;</sup>We preached to you the Good News. So if we ourselves, or even an angel from heaven, should preach to you something different, we should be judged guilty! <sup>9&nbsp;</sup>I said this before, and now I say it again: You have already accepted the Good News. If anyone is preaching something different to you, let that person be judged guilty!</p>

	<p><sup>10&nbsp;</sup>Do you think I am trying to make people accept me? No, God is the One I am trying to please. Am I trying to please people? If I still wanted to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ.</p>

	<h3>Paul’s Authority Is from God</h3>

	<p><sup>11&nbsp;</sup>Brothers and sisters, I want you to know that the Good News I preached to you was not made up by human beings. <sup>12&nbsp;</sup>I did not get it from humans, nor did anyone teach it to me, but Jesus Christ showed it to me.</p>

	<p><sup>13&nbsp;</sup>You have heard about my past life in the Jewish religion. I attacked the church of God and tried to destroy it. <sup>14&nbsp;</sup>I was becoming a leader in the Jewish religion, doing better than most other Jews of my age. I tried harder than anyone else to follow the teachings handed down by our ancestors.</p>

	<p><sup>15&nbsp;</sup>But God had special plans for me and set me apart for his work even before I was born. He called me through his grace <sup>16&nbsp;</sup>and showed his son to me so that I might tell the Good News about him to those who are not Jewish. When God called me, I did not get advice or help from any person. <sup>17&nbsp;</sup>I did not go to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was. But, without waiting, I went away to Arabia and later went back to Damascus.</p>

	<p><sup>18&nbsp;</sup>After three years I went to Jerusalem to meet Peter and stayed with him for fifteen days. <sup>19&nbsp;</sup>I met no other apostles, except James, the brother of the Lord. <sup>20&nbsp;</sup>God knows that these things I write are not lies. <sup>21&nbsp;</sup>Later, I went to the areas of Syria and Cilicia.</p>

	<p><sup>22&nbsp;</sup>In Judea the churches in Christ had never met me. <sup>23&nbsp;</sup>They had only heard it said, “This man who was attacking us is now preaching the same faith that he once tried to destroy.” <sup>24&nbsp;</sup>And these believers praised God because of me.</p>

	<h3>Other Apostles Accepted Paul</h3>

	<p><a class="ch">2</a>After fourteen years I went to Jerusalem again, this time with Barnabas. I also took Titus with me. <sup>2&nbsp;</sup>I went because God showed me I should go. I met with the believers there, and in private I told their leaders the Good News that I preach to the non-Jewish people. I did not want my past work and the work I am now doing to be wasted. <sup>3&nbsp;</sup>Titus was with me, but he was not forced to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek. <sup>4&nbsp;</sup>We talked about this problem because some false believers had come into our group secretly. They came in like spies to overturn the freedom we have in Christ Jesus. They wanted to make us slaves. <sup>5&nbsp;</sup>But we did not give in to those false believers for a minute. We wanted the truth of the Good News to continue for you.<p></p>

	<p><sup>6&nbsp;</sup>Those leaders who seemed to be important did not change the Good News that I preach. (It doesn’t matter to me if they were “important” or not. To God everyone is the same.) <sup>7&nbsp;</sup>But these leaders saw that I had been given the work of telling the Good News to those who are not Jewish, just as Peter had the work of telling the Jews. <sup>8&nbsp;</sup>God gave Peter the power to work as an apostle for the Jewish people. But he also gave me the power to work as an apostle for those who are not Jews. <sup>9&nbsp;</sup>James, Peter, and John, who seemed to be the leaders, understood that God had given me this special grace, so they accepted Barnabas and me. They agreed that they would go to the Jewish people and that we should go to those who are not Jewish. <sup>10&nbsp;</sup>The only thing they asked us was to remember to help the poor—something I really wanted to do.</p>

	<h3>Paul Shows that Peter Was Wrong</h3>

	<p><sup>11&nbsp;</sup>When Peter came to Antioch, I challenged him to his face, because he was wrong. <sup>12&nbsp;</sup>Peter ate with the non-Jewish people until some Jewish people sent from James came to Antioch. When they arrived, Peter stopped eating with those who weren’t Jewish, and he separated himself from them. He was afraid of the Jews. <sup>13&nbsp;</sup>So Peter was a hypocrite, as were the other Jewish believers who joined with him. Even Barnabas was influenced by what these Jewish believers did. <sup>14&nbsp;</sup>When I saw they were not following the truth of the Good News, I spoke to Peter in front of them all. I said, “Peter, you are a Jew, but you are not living like a Jew. You are living like those who are not Jewish. So why do you now try to force those who are not Jewish to live like Jews?”</p>

	<p><sup>15&nbsp;</sup>We were not born as non-Jewish “sinners,” but as Jews. <sup>16&nbsp;</sup>Yet we know that a person is made right with God not by following the law, but by trusting in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus, that we might be made right with God because we trusted in Christ. It is not because we followed the law, because no one can be made right with God by following the law.</p>

	<p><sup>17&nbsp;</sup>We Jews came to Christ, trying to be made right with God, and it became clear that we are sinners, too. Does this mean that Christ encourages sin? No! <sup>18&nbsp;</sup>But I would really be wrong to begin teaching again those things that I gave up. <sup>19&nbsp;</sup>It was the law that put me to death, and I died to the law so that I can now live for God. <sup>20&nbsp;</sup>I was put to death on the cross with Christ, and I do not live anymore—it is Christ who lives in me. I still live in my body, but I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself to save me. <sup>21&nbsp;</sup>By saying these things I am not going against God’s grace. Just the opposite, if the law could make us right with God, then Christ’s death would be useless.</p>

	<h3>Blessing Comes Through Faith</h3>

	<p><a class="ch">3</a>You people in Galatia were told very clearly about the death of Jesus Christ on the cross. But you were foolish; you let someone trick you. <sup>2&nbsp;</sup>Tell me this one thing: How did you receive the Holy Spirit? Did you receive the Spirit by following the law? No, you received the Spirit because you heard the Good News and believed it. <sup>3&nbsp;</sup>You began your life in Christ by the Spirit. Now are you trying to make it complete by your own power? That is foolish. <sup>4&nbsp;</sup>Were all your experiences wasted? I hope not! <sup>5&nbsp;</sup>Does God give you the Spirit and work miracles among you because you follow the law? No, he does these things because you heard the Good News and believed it.<p></p>

	<p><sup>6&nbsp;</sup>The Scriptures say the same thing about Abraham: “Abraham believed God, and God accepted Abraham’s faith, and that faith made him right with God.” <sup>7&nbsp;</sup>So you should know that the true children of Abraham are those who have faith. <sup>8&nbsp;</sup>The Scriptures, telling what would happen in the future, said that God would make the non-Jewish people right through their faith. This Good News was told to Abraham beforehand, as the Scripture says: “All nations will be blessed through you.” <sup>9&nbsp;</sup>So all who believe as Abraham believed are blessed just as Abraham was. <sup>10&nbsp;</sup>But those who depend on following the law to make them right are under a curse, because the Scriptures say, “Anyone will be cursed who does not always obey what is written in the Book of the Law.” <sup>11&nbsp;</sup>Now it is clear that no one can be made right with God by the law, because the Scriptures say, “Those who are right with God will live by faith.” <sup>12&nbsp;</sup>The law is not based on faith. It says, “A person who obeys these things will live because of them.” <sup>13&nbsp;</sup>Christ took away the curse the law put on us. He changed places with us and put himself under that curse. It is written in the Scriptures, “Anyone whose body is displayed on a tree is cursed.” <sup>14&nbsp;</sup>Christ did this so that God’s blessing promised to Abraham might come through Jesus Christ to those who are not Jews. Jesus died so that by our believing we could receive the Spirit that God promised.</p>

	<h3>The Law and the Promise</h3>

	<p><sup>15&nbsp;</sup>Brothers and sisters, let us think in human terms: Even an agreement made between two persons is firm. After that agreement is accepted by both people, no one can stop it or add anything to it. <sup>16&nbsp;</sup>God made promises both to Abraham and to his descendant. God did not say, “and to your descendants.” That would mean many people. But God said, “and to your descendant.” That means only one person; that person is Christ. <sup>17&nbsp;</sup>This is what I mean: God had an agreement with Abraham and promised to keep it. The law, which came four hundred thirty years later, cannot change that agreement and so destroy God’s promise to Abraham. <sup>18&nbsp;</sup>If the law could give us Abraham’s blessing, then the promise would not be necessary. But that is not possible, because God freely gave his blessings to Abraham through the promise he had made.</p>

	<p><sup>19&nbsp;</sup>So what was the law for? It was given to show that the wrong things people do are against God’s will. And it continued until the special descendant, who had been promised, came. The law was given through angels who used Moses for a mediator to give the law to people. <sup>20&nbsp;</sup>But a mediator is not needed when there is only one side, and God is only one.</p>

	<h3>The Purpose of the Law of Moses</h3>

	<p><sup>21&nbsp;</sup>Does this mean that the law is against God’s promises? Never! That would be true only if the law could make us right with God. But God did not give a law that can bring life. <sup>22&nbsp;</sup>Instead, the Scriptures showed that the whole world is bound by sin. This was so the promise would be given through faith to people who believe in Jesus Christ.</p>

	<p><sup>23&nbsp;</sup>Before this faith came, we were all held prisoners by the law. We had no freedom until God showed us the way of faith that was coming. <sup>24&nbsp;</sup>In other words, the law was our guardian leading us to Christ so that we could be made right with God through faith. <sup>25&nbsp;</sup>Now the way of faith has come, and we no longer live under a guardian.</p>

	<p><sup>26-27&nbsp;</sup>You were all baptized into Christ, and so you were all clothed with Christ. This means that you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus. <sup>28&nbsp;</sup>In Christ, there is no difference between Jew and Greek, slave and free person, male and female. You are all the same in Christ Jesus. <sup>29&nbsp;</sup>You belong to Christ, so you are Abraham’s descendants. You will inherit all of God’s blessings because of the promise God made to Abraham.</p>

	<p><a class="ch">4</a>I want to tell you this: While those who will inherit their fathers’ property are still children, they are no different from slaves. It does not matter that the children own everything. <sup>2&nbsp;</sup>While they are children, they must obey those who are chosen to care for them. But when the children reach the age set by their fathers, they are free. <sup>3&nbsp;</sup>It is the same for us. We were once like children, slaves to the useless rules of this world. <sup>4&nbsp;</sup>But when the right time came, God sent his Son who was born of a woman and lived under the law. <sup>5&nbsp;</sup>God did this so he could buy freedom for those who were under the law and so we could become his children.<p></p>

	<p><sup>6&nbsp;</sup>Since you are God’s children, God sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, and the Spirit cries out, “Father.” <sup>7&nbsp;</sup>So now you are not a slave; you are God’s child, and God will give you the blessing he promised, because you are his child.</p>

	<h3>Paul’s Love for the Christians</h3>

	<p><sup>8&nbsp;</sup>In the past you did not know God. You were slaves to gods that were not real. <sup>9&nbsp;</sup>But now you know the true God. Really, it is God who knows you. So why do you turn back to those weak and useless rules you followed before? Do you want to be slaves to those things again? <sup>10&nbsp;</sup>You still follow teachings about special days, months, seasons, and years. <sup>11&nbsp;</sup>I am afraid for you, that my work for you has been wasted.</p>

	<p><sup>12&nbsp;</sup>Brothers and sisters, I became like you, so I beg you to become like me. You were very good to me before. <sup>13&nbsp;</sup>You remember that it was because of an illness that I came to you the first time, preaching the Good News. <sup>14&nbsp;</sup>Though my sickness was a trouble for you, you did not hate me or make me leave. But you welcomed me as an angel from God, as if I were Jesus Christ himself! <sup>15&nbsp;</sup>You were very happy then, but where is that joy now? I am ready to testify that you would have taken out your eyes and given them to me if that were possible. <sup>16&nbsp;</sup>Now am I your enemy because I tell you the truth?</p>

	<p><sup>17&nbsp;</sup>Those people are working hard to persuade you, but this is not good for you. They want to persuade you to turn against us and follow only them. <sup>18&nbsp;</sup>It is good for people to show interest in you, but only if their purpose is good. This is always true, not just when I am with you. <sup>19&nbsp;</sup>My little children, again I feel the pain of childbirth for you until you truly become like Christ. <sup>20&nbsp;</sup>I wish I could be with you now and could change the way I am talking to you, because I do not know what to think about you.</p>

	<h3>The Example of Hagar and Sarah</h3>

	<p><sup>21&nbsp;</sup>Some of you still want to be under the law. Tell me, do you know what the law says? <sup>22&nbsp;</sup>The Scriptures say that Abraham had two sons. The mother of one son was a slave woman, and the mother of the other son was a free woman. <sup>23&nbsp;</sup>Abraham’s son from the slave woman was born in the normal human way. But the son from the free woman was born because of the promise God made to Abraham.</p>

	<p><sup>24&nbsp;</sup>This story teaches something else: The two women are like the two agreements between God and his people. One agreement is the law that God made on Mount Sinai, and the people who are under this agreement are like slaves. The mother named Hagar is like that agreement. <sup>25&nbsp;</sup>She is like Mount Sinai in Arabia and is a picture of the earthly city of Jerusalem. This city and its people are slaves to the law. <sup>26&nbsp;</sup>But the heavenly Jerusalem, which is above, is like the free woman. She is our mother. <sup>27&nbsp;</sup>It is written in the Scriptures:</p>

	<p>“Be happy, Jerusalem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are like a woman who never gave birth to children.Start singing and shout for joy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You never felt the pain of giving birth,but you will have more children&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than the woman who has a husband.” Isaiah 54:1</p>

	<p><sup>28&nbsp;</sup>My brothers and sisters, you are God’s children because of his promise, as Isaac was then. <sup>29&nbsp;</sup>The son who was born in the normal way treated the other son badly. It is the same today. <sup>30&nbsp;</sup>But what does the Scripture say? “Throw out the slave woman and her son. The son of the slave woman should not inherit anything. The son of the free woman should receive it all.” <sup>31&nbsp;</sup>So, my brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.</p>

	<h3>Keep Your Freedom</h3>

	<p><a class="ch">5</a>We have freedom now, because Christ made us free. So stand strong. Do not change and go back into the slavery of the law. <sup>2&nbsp;</sup>Listen, I Paul tell you that if you go back to the law by being circumcised, Christ does you no good. <sup>3&nbsp;</sup>Again, I warn every man: If you allow yourselves to be circumcised, you must follow all the law. <sup>4&nbsp;</sup>If you try to be made right with God through the law, your life with Christ is over—you have left God’s grace. <sup>5&nbsp;</sup>But we have the true hope that comes from being made right with God, and by the Spirit we wait eagerly for this hope. <sup>6&nbsp;</sup>When we are in Christ Jesus, it is not important if we are circumcised or not. The important thing is faith—the kind of faith that works through love.<p></p>

	<p><sup>7&nbsp;</sup>You were running a good race. Who stopped you from following the true way? <sup>8&nbsp;</sup>This change did not come from the One who chose you. <sup>9&nbsp;</sup>Be careful! “Just a little yeast makes the whole batch of dough rise.” <sup>10&nbsp;</sup>But I trust in the Lord that you will not believe those different ideas. Whoever is confusing you with such ideas will be punished.</p>

	<p><sup>11&nbsp;</sup>My brothers and sisters, I do not teach that a man must be circumcised. If I teach circumcision, why am I still being attacked? If I still taught circumcision, my preaching about the cross would not be a problem. <sup>12&nbsp;</sup>I wish the people who are bothering you would castrate themselves!</p>

	<p><sup>13&nbsp;</sup>My brothers and sisters, God called you to be free, but do not use your freedom as an excuse to do what pleases your sinful self. Serve each other with love. <sup>14&nbsp;</sup>The whole law is made complete in this one command: “Love your neighbor as you love yourself.” <sup>15&nbsp;</sup>If you go on hurting each other and tearing each other apart, be careful, or you will completely destroy each other.</p>

	<h3>The Spirit and Human Nature</h3>

	<p><sup>16&nbsp;</sup>So I tell you: Live by following the Spirit. Then you will not do what your sinful selves want. <sup>17&nbsp;</sup>Our sinful selves want what is against the Spirit, and the Spirit wants what is against our sinful selves. The two are against each other, so you cannot do just what you please. <sup>18&nbsp;</sup>But if the Spirit is leading you, you are not under the law.</p>


	<p><sup>19&nbsp;</sup>The wrong things the sinful self does are clear: being sexually unfaithful, not being pure, taking part in sexual sins, <sup>20&nbsp;</sup>worshiping gods, doing witchcraft, hating, making trouble, being jealous, being angry, being selfish, making people angry with each other, causing divisions among people, <sup>21&nbsp;</sup>feeling envy, being drunk, having wild and wasteful parties, and doing other things like these. I warn you now as I warned you before: Those who do these things will not inherit God’s kingdom. <sup>22&nbsp;</sup>But the Spirit produces the fruit of <span class="wordcomment" data-comment="ἀγάπη (agapé). Putting someone else first.">love</span>, <span class="wordcomment" data-comment="χαρά (chara). Joy">joy</span>, <span class="wordcomment" data-comment="εἰρήνη (eiréné).

Power with reserve + gentleness">gentleness</span>, <span class="wordcomment" data-comment="ἐγκράτεια (egkrateia). Mastery of self.">self-control</span>. There is no law that says these things are wrong. <sup>24&nbsp;</sup>Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified their own sinful selves. They have given up their old selfish feelings and the evil things they wanted to do. <sup>25&nbsp;</sup>We get our new life from the Spirit, so we should follow the Spirit. <sup>26&nbsp;</sup>We must not be proud or make trouble with each other or be jealous of each other.</p>
	<h3>Help Each Other</h3>

	<p><a class="ch">6</a>Brothers and sisters, if someone in your group does something wrong, you who are spiritual should go to that person and gently help make him right again. But be careful, because you might be tempted to sin, too. <sup>2&nbsp;</sup>By helping each other with your troubles, you truly obey the law of Christ. <sup>3&nbsp;</sup>If anyone thinks he is important when he really is not, he is only fooling himself. <sup>4&nbsp;</sup>Each person should judge his own actions and not compare himself with others. Then he can be proud for what he himself has done. <sup>5&nbsp;</sup>Each person must be responsible for himself.<p></p>

	<p><sup>6&nbsp;</sup>Anyone who is learning the teaching of God should share all the good things he has with his teacher.</p>

	<h3>Life Is like Planting a Field</h3>

	<p><sup>7&nbsp;</sup>Do not be fooled: You cannot cheat God. People harvest only what they plant. <sup>8&nbsp;</sup>If they plant to satisfy their sinful selves, their sinful selves will bring them ruin. But if they plant to please the Spirit, they will receive eternal life from the Spirit. <sup>9&nbsp;</sup>We must not become tired of doing good. We will receive our harvest of eternal life at the right time if we do not give up. <sup>10&nbsp;</sup>When we have the opportunity to help anyone, we should do it. But we should give special attention to those who are in the family of believers.</p>

	<h3>Paul Ends His Letter</h3>

	<p><sup>11&nbsp;</sup>See what large letters I use to write this myself. <sup>12&nbsp;</sup>Some people are trying to force you to be circumcised so the Jews will accept them. They are afraid they will be attacked if they follow only the cross of Christ. <sup>13&nbsp;</sup>Those who are circumcised do not obey the law themselves, but they want you to be circumcised so they can brag about what they forced you to do. <sup>14&nbsp;</sup>I hope I will never brag about things like that. The cross of our Lord Jesus Christ is my only reason for bragging. Through the cross of Jesus my world was crucified, and I died to the world. <sup>15&nbsp;</sup>It is not important if a man is circumcised or uncircumcised. The important thing is being the new people God has made. <sup>16&nbsp;</sup>Peace and mercy to those who follow this rule—and to all of God’s people.</p>

	<p><sup>17&nbsp;</sup>So do not give me any more trouble. I have scars on my body that show I belong to Christ Jesus.</p>

	<p><sup>18&nbsp;</sup>My brothers and sisters, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>

      <sup>1</sup> How blessed is the one who does not follow the advice of the wicked, or stand in the pathway with sinners, or
      sit in the assembly of scoffers!
      <sup>2</sup> Instead he finds pleasure in obeying the LORD&#39;s commands; he meditates on his commands day and night.
      <sup>3</sup> He is like a tree planted by flowing streams; it yields its fruit at the proper time, and its leaves never fall
      off. He succeeds in everything he attempts.
      <sup>4</sup> Not so with the wicked! Instead they are like wind-driven chaff.
      <sup>5</sup> For this reason the wicked cannot withstand judgment, nor can sinners join the assembly of the godly.
      <sup>6</sup> Certainly the LORD guards the way of the godly, but the way of the wicked ends in destruction.</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">2</a>
      <sup>1</sup> Why do the nations rebel? Why are the countries devising plots that will fail?
      <sup>2</sup> The kings of the earth form a united front; the rulers collaborate against the LORD and his anointed king.
      <sup>3</sup> They say, &quot;Let&#39;s tear off the shackles they&#39;ve put on us! Let&#39;s free ourselves from their
      ropes!&quot;
      <sup>4</sup> The one enthroned in heaven laughs in disgust; the Lord taunts them.
      <sup>5</sup> Then he angrily speaks to them and terrifies them in his rage, saying,
      <sup>6</sup> &quot;I myself have installed my king on Zion, my holy hill.&quot;
      <sup>7</sup> The king says, &quot;I will announce the LORD&#39;S decree. He said to me: &#39;You are my son! This very day I
      have become your father!
      <sup>8</sup> Ask me, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance, the ends of the earth as your personal property.
      <sup>9</sup> You will break them with an iron scepter; you will smash them like a potter&#39;s jar!&#39;&quot;
      <sup>10</sup> So now, you kings, do what is wise; you rulers of the earth, submit to correction!
      <sup>11</sup> Serve the LORD in fear! Repent in terror!
      <sup>12</sup> Give sincere homage! Otherwise he will be angry, and you will die because of your behavior, when his anger
      quickly ignites. How blessed are all who take shelter in him!</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">3</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [A psalm of David, written when he fled from his son Absalom.] LORD, how numerous are my enemies! Many attack
      me.
      <sup>2</sup> Many say about me, &quot;God will not deliver him.&quot; (Selah)
      <sup>3</sup> But you, LORD, are a shield that protects me; you are my glory and the one who restores me.
      <sup>4</sup> To the LORD I cried out, and he answered me from his holy hill. (Selah)
      <sup>5</sup> I rested and slept; I awoke, for the LORD protects me.
      <sup>6</sup> I am not afraid of the multitude of people who attack me from all directions.
      <sup>7</sup> Rise up, LORD! Deliver me, my God! Yes, you will strike all my enemies on the jaw; you will break the teeth of
      the wicked.
      <sup>8</sup> The LORD delivers; you show favor to your people. (Selah)</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">4</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments; a psalm of David.] When I call out, answer
      me, O God who vindicates me! Though I am hemmed in, you will lead me into a wide, open place. Have mercy on me and respond to
      my prayer!
      <sup>2</sup> You men, how long will you try to turn my honor into shame? How long will you love what is worthless and search
      for what is deceptive? (Selah)
      <sup>3</sup> Realize that the LORD shows the godly special favor; the LORD responds when I cry out to him.
      <sup>4</sup> Tremble with fear and do not sin! Meditate as you lie in bed, and repent of your ways! (Selah)
      <sup>5</sup> Offer the prescribed sacrifices and trust in the LORD!
      <sup>6</sup> Many say, &quot;Who can show us anything good?&quot; Smile upon us, LORD!
      <sup>7</sup> You make me happier than those who have abundant grain and wine.
      <sup>8</sup> I will lie down and sleep peacefully, for you, LORD, make me safe and secure.</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">5</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [For the music director, to be accompanied by wind instruments; a psalm of David.] Listen to what I say, LORD!
      Carefully consider my complaint!
      <sup>2</sup> Pay attention to my cry for help, my king and my God, for I am praying to you!
      <sup>3</sup> LORD, in the morning you will hear me; in the morning I will present my case to you and then wait expectantly
      for an answer.
      <sup>4</sup> Certainly you are not a God who approves of evil; evil people cannot dwell with you.
      <sup>5</sup> Arrogant people cannot stand in your presence; you hate all who behave wickedly.
      <sup>6</sup> You destroy liars; the LORD despises violent and deceitful people.
      <sup>7</sup> But as for me, because of your great faithfulness I will enter your house; I will bow down toward your holy
      temple as I worship you.
      <sup>8</sup> LORD, lead me in your righteousness because of those who wait to ambush me, remove the obstacles in the way in
      which you are guiding me!
      <sup>9</sup> For they do not speak the truth; their stomachs are like the place of destruction, their throats like an open
      grave, their tongues like a steep slope leading into it.
      <sup>10</sup> Condemn them, O God! May their own schemes be their downfall! Drive them away because of their many acts of
      insurrection, for they have rebelled against you.
      <sup>11</sup> But may all who take shelter in you be happy! May they continually shout for joy! Shelter them so that those
      who are loyal to you may rejoice!
      <sup>12</sup> Certainly you reward the godly, LORD. Like a shield you protect them in your good favor.</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">6</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments, according to the sheminith style; a psalm of
      David.] LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger! Do not discipline me in your raging fury!
      <sup>2</sup> Have mercy on me, LORD, for I am frail! Heal me, LORD, for my bones are shaking!
      <sup>3</sup> I am absolutely terrified, and you, LORD, how long will this continue?
      <sup>4</sup> Relent, LORD, rescue me! Deliver me because of your faithfulness!
      <sup>5</sup> For no one remembers you in the realm of death, In Sheol who gives you thanks?
      <sup>6</sup> I am exhausted as I groan; all night long I drench my bed in tears; my tears saturate the cushion beneath me.
      <sup>7</sup> My eyes grow dim from suffering; they grow weak because of all my enemies.
      <sup>8</sup> Turn back from me, all you who behave wickedly, for the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping!
      <sup>9</sup> The LORD has heard my appeal for mercy; the LORD has accepted my prayer.
      <sup>10</sup> May all my enemies be humiliated and absolutely terrified! May they turn back and be suddenly humiliated!</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">7</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [A musical composition by David, which he sang to the LORD concerning a Benjaminite named Cush.] O LORD my God,
      in you I have taken shelter. Deliver me from all who chase me! Rescue me!
      <sup>2</sup> Otherwise they will rip me to shreds like a lion; they will tear me to bits and no one will be able to rescue
      me.
      <sup>3</sup> O LORD my God, if I have done what they say, or am guilty of unjust actions,
      <sup>4</sup> or have wronged my ally, or helped his lawless enemy,
      <sup>5</sup> may an enemy relentlessly chase me and catch me; may he trample me to death and leave me lying dishonored in the
      dust. (Selah)
      <sup>6</sup> Stand up angrily, LORD! Rise up with raging fury against my enemies! Wake up for my sake and execute the
      judgment you have decreed for them!
      <sup>7</sup> The countries are assembled all around you; take once more your rightful place over them!
      <sup>8</sup> The LORD judges the nations. Vindicate me, LORD, because I am innocent, because I am blameless, O Exalted One!
      <sup>9</sup> May the evil deeds of the wicked come to an end! But make the innocent secure, O righteous God, you who examine
      inner thoughts and motives!
      <sup>10</sup> The Exalted God is my shield, the one who delivers the morally upright.
      <sup>11</sup> God is a just judge; he is angry throughout the day.
      <sup>12</sup> If a person does not repent, God sharpens his sword and prepares to shoot his bow.
      <sup>13</sup> He prepares to use deadly weapons against him; he gets ready to shoot flaming arrows.
      <sup>14</sup> See the one who is pregnant with wickedness, who conceives destructive plans, and gives birth to harmful lies,
      <sup>15</sup> he digs a pit and then falls into the hole he has made.
      <sup>16</sup> He becomes the victim of his own destructive plans and the violence he intended for others falls on his own
      head.
      <sup>17</sup> I will thank the LORD for his justice; I will sing praises to the sovereign LORD!</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">8</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [For the music director, according to the gittith style; a psalm of David.] O LORD, our Lord, how magnificent is
      your reputation throughout the earth! You reveal your majesty in the heavens above!
      <sup>2</sup> From the mouths of children and nursing babies you have ordained praise on account of your adversaries, so that
      you might put an end to the vindictive enemy.
      <sup>3</sup> When I look up at the heavens, which your fingers made, and see the moon and the stars, which you set in place,
      <sup>4</sup> Of what importance is the human race, that you should notice them? Of what importance is mankind, that you
      should pay attention to them,
      <sup>5</sup> and make them a little less than the heavenly beings? You grant mankind honor and majesty;
      <sup>6</sup> you appoint them to rule over your creation; you have placed everything under their authority,
      <sup>7</sup> including all the sheep and cattle, as well as the wild animals,
      <sup>8</sup> the birds in the sky, the fish in the sea and everything that moves through the currents of the seas.
      <sup>9</sup> O LORD, our Lord, how magnificent is your reputation throughout the earth!</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">9</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [For the music director; according to the alumoth-labben style; a psalm of David.] I will thank the LORD with
      all my heart! I will tell about all your amazing deeds!
      <sup>2</sup> I will be happy and rejoice in you! I will sing praises to you, O sovereign One!
      <sup>3</sup> When my enemies turn back, they trip and are defeated before you.
      <sup>4</sup> For you defended my just cause; from your throne you pronounced a just decision.
      <sup>5</sup> You terrified the nations with your battle cry; you destroyed the wicked; you permanently wiped out all memory
      of them.
      <sup>6</sup> The enemy&#39;s cities have been reduced to permanent ruins; you destroyed their cities; all memory of the
      enemies has perished.
      <sup>7</sup> But the LORD rules forever; he reigns in a just manner.
      <sup>8</sup> He judges the world fairly; he makes just legal decisions for the nations.
      <sup>9</sup> Consequently the LORD provides safety for the oppressed; he provides safety in times of trouble.
      <sup>10</sup> Your loyal followers trust in you, for you, LORD, do not abandon those who seek your help.
      <sup>11</sup> Sing praises to the LORD, who rules in Zion! Tell the nations what he has done!
      <sup>12</sup> For the one who takes revenge against murderers took notice of the oppressed; he did not overlook their cry for
      help
      <sup>13</sup> when they prayed: &quot;Have mercy on me, LORD! See how I am oppressed by those who hate me, O one who can
      snatch me away from the gates of death!
      <sup>14</sup> Then I will tell about all your praiseworthy acts; in the gates of Daughter Zion I will rejoice because of your
      deliverance.&quot;
      <sup>15</sup> The nations fell into the pit they had made; their feet were caught in the net they had hidden.
      <sup>16</sup> The LORD revealed himself; he accomplished justice; the wicked were ensnared by their own actions. (Higgaion.
      Selah)
      <sup>17</sup> The wicked are turned back and sent to Sheol; this is the destiny of all the nations that ignore God,
      <sup>18</sup> for the needy are not permanently ignored, the hopes of the oppressed are not forever dashed.
      <sup>19</sup> Rise up, LORD! Don&#39;t let men be defiant! May the nations be judged in your presence!
      <sup>20</sup> Terrify them, LORD! Let the nations know they are mere mortals! (Selah)</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">10</a>
      <sup>1</sup> Why, LORD, do you stand far off? Why do you pay no attention during times of trouble?
      <sup>2</sup> The wicked arrogantly chase the oppressed; the oppressed are trapped by the schemes the wicked have dreamed up.
      <sup>3</sup> Yes, the wicked man boasts because he gets what he wants; the one who robs others curses and rejects the LORD.
      <sup>4</sup> The wicked man is so arrogant he always thinks, &quot;God won&#39;t hold me accountable; he doesn&#39;t
      care.&quot;
      <sup>5</sup> He is secure at all times. He has no regard for your commands; he disdains all his enemies.
      <sup>6</sup> He says to himself, &quot;I will never be upended, because I experience no calamity.&quot;
      <sup>7</sup> His mouth is full of curses and deceptive, harmful words; his tongue injures and destroys.
      <sup>8</sup> He waits in ambush near the villages; in hidden places he kills the innocent. His eyes look for some unfortunate
      victim.
      <sup>9</sup> He lies in ambush in a hidden place, like a lion in a thicket; he lies in ambush, waiting to catch the
      oppressed; he catches the oppressed by pulling in his net.
      <sup>10</sup> His victims are crushed and beaten down; they are trapped in his sturdy nets.
      <sup>11</sup> He says to himself, &quot;God overlooks it; he does not pay attention; he never notices.&quot;
      <sup>12</sup> Rise up, LORD! O God, strike him down! Do not forget the oppressed!
      <sup>13</sup> Why does the wicked man reject God? He says to himself, &quot;You will not hold me accountable.&quot;
      <sup>14</sup> You have taken notice, for you always see one who inflicts pain and suffering. The unfortunate victim entrusts
      his cause to you; you deliver the fatherless.
      <sup>15</sup> Break the arm of the wicked and evil man! Hold him accountable for his wicked deeds, which he thought you would
      not discover.
      <sup>16</sup> The LORD rules forever! The nations are driven out of his land.
      <sup>17</sup> LORD, you have heard the request of the oppressed; you make them feel secure because you listen to their
      prayer.
      <sup>18</sup> You defend the fatherless and oppressed, so that mere mortals may no longer terrorize them.</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">11</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [For the music director; by David.] In the LORD I have taken shelter. How can you say to me, &quot;Flee to a
      mountain like a bird!
      <sup>2</sup> For look, the wicked prepare their bows, they put their arrows on the strings, to shoot in the darkness at the
      morally upright.
      <sup>3</sup> When the foundations are destroyed, what can the godly accomplish?&quot;
      <sup>4</sup> The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD&#39;s throne is in heaven. His eyes watch; his eyes examine all people.
      <sup>5</sup> The LORD approves of the godly, but he hates the wicked and those who love to do violence.
      <sup>6</sup> May the LORD rain down burning coals and brimstone on the wicked! A whirlwind is what they deserve!
      <sup>7</sup> Certainly the LORD is just; he rewards godly deeds; the upright will experience his favor.</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">12</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [For the music director; according to the sheminith style; a psalm of David.] Deliver, LORD! For the godly have
      disappeared; people of integrity have vanished.
      <sup>2</sup> People lie to one another; they flatter and deceive.
      <sup>3</sup> May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that boasts!
      <sup>4</sup> They say, &quot;We speak persuasively; we know how to flatter and boast. Who is our master?&quot;
      <sup>5</sup> &quot;Because of the violence done to the oppressed, because of the painful cries of the needy, I will spring
      into action,&quot; says the LORD. &quot;I will provide the safety they so desperately desire.&quot;
      <sup>6</sup> The LORD&#39;s words are absolutely reliable. They are as untainted as silver purified in a furnace on the
      ground, where it is thoroughly refined.
      <sup>7</sup> You, LORD, will protect them; you will continually shelter each one from these evil people,
      <sup>8</sup> for the wicked seem to be everywhere, when people promote evil.</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">13</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [For the music director; a psalm of David.] How long, LORD, will you continue to ignore me? How long will you
      pay no attention to me?
      <sup>2</sup> How long must I worry, and suffer in broad daylight? How long will my enemy gloat over me?
      <sup>3</sup> Look at me! Answer me, O LORD my God! Revive me, or else I will die!
      <sup>4</sup> Then my enemy will say, &quot;I have defeated him!&quot; Then my foes will rejoice because I am upended.
      <sup>5</sup> But I trust in your faithfulness. May I rejoice because of your deliverance!
      <sup>6</sup> I will sing praises to the LORD when he vindicates me.</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">14</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [For the music director; by David.] Fools say to themselves, &quot;There is no God.&quot; They sin and commit
      evil deeds; none of them does what is right.
      <sup>2</sup> The LORD looks down from heaven at the human race, to see if there is anyone who is wise and seeks God.
      <sup>3</sup> Everyone rejects God; they are all morally corrupt. None of them does what is right, not even one!
      <sup>4</sup> All those who behave wickedly do not understand, those who devour my people as if they were eating bread, and do
      not call out to the LORD.
      <sup>5</sup> They are absolutely terrified, for God defends the godly.
      <sup>6</sup> You want to humiliate the oppressed, even though the LORD is their shelter.
      <sup>7</sup> I wish the deliverance of Israel would come from Zion! When the LORD restores the well-being of his people, may
      Jacob rejoice, may Israel be happy!</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">15</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [A psalm of David.] LORD, who may be a guest in your home? Who may live on your holy hill?
      <sup>2</sup> Whoever lives a blameless life, does what is right, and speaks honestly.
      <sup>3</sup> He does not slander, or do harm to others, or insult his neighbor.
      <sup>4</sup> He despises a reprobate, but honors the LORD&#39;s loyal followers. He makes firm commitments and does not
      renege on his promise.
      <sup>5</sup> He does not charge interest when he lends his money. He does not take bribes to testify against the innocent.
      The one who lives like this will never be upended.</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">16</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [A prayer of David.] Protect me, O God, for I have taken shelter in you.
      <sup>2</sup> I say to the LORD, &quot;You are the Lord, my only source of well-being.&quot;
      <sup>3</sup> As for God&#39;s chosen people who are in the land, and the leading officials I admired so much,
      <sup>4</sup> their troubles multiply, they desire other gods. I will not pour out drink offerings of blood to their gods, nor
      will I make vows in the name of their gods.
      <sup>5</sup> LORD, you give me stability and prosperity; you make my future secure.
      <sup>6</sup> It is as if I have been given fertile fields or received a beautiful tract of land.
      <sup>7</sup> I will praise the LORD who guides me; yes, during the night I reflect and learn.
      <sup>8</sup> I constantly trust in the LORD; because he is at my right hand, I will not be upended.
      <sup>9</sup> So my heart rejoices and I am happy; My life is safe.
      <sup>10</sup> You will not abandon me to Sheol; you will not allow your faithful follower to see the Pit.
      <sup>11</sup> You lead me in the path of life; I experience absolute joy in your presence; you always give me sheer
      delight.</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">17</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [A prayer of David.] LORD, consider my just cause! Pay attention to my cry for help! Listen to the prayer I
      sincerely offer!
      <sup>2</sup> Make a just decision on my behalf! Decide what is right!
      <sup>3</sup> You have scrutinized my inner motives; you have examined me during the night. You have carefully evaluated me,
      but you find no sin. I am determined I will say nothing sinful.
      <sup>4</sup> As for the actions of people, just as you have commanded, I have not followed in the footsteps of violent men.
      <sup>5</sup> I carefully obey your commands; I do not deviate from them.
      <sup>6</sup> I call to you for you will answer me, O God. Listen to me! Hear what I say!
      <sup>7</sup> Accomplish awesome, faithful deeds, you who powerfully deliver those who look to you for protection from their
      enemies.
      <sup>8</sup> Protect me as you would protect the pupil of your eye! Hide me in the shadow of your wings!
      <sup>9</sup> Protect me from the wicked men who attack me, my enemies who crowd around me for the kill.
      <sup>10</sup> They are calloused; they speak arrogantly.
      <sup>11</sup> They attack me, now they surround me; they intend to throw me to the ground.
      <sup>12</sup> He is like a lion that wants to tear its prey to bits, like a young lion crouching in hidden places.
      <sup>13</sup> Rise up, LORD! Confront him! Knock him down! Use your sword to rescue me from the wicked man!
      <sup>14</sup> LORD, use your power to deliver me from these murderers, from the murderers of this world! They enjoy
      prosperity; you overwhelm them with the riches they desire. They have many children, and leave their wealth to their
      offspring.
      <sup>15</sup> As for me, because I am innocent I will see your face; when I awake you will reveal yourself to me.</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">18</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [For the music director; by the LORD&#39;s servant David, who sang to the LORD the words of this song when the
      LORD rescued him from the power of all his enemies, including Saul.] He said: &quot;I love you, LORD, my source of strength!
      <sup>2</sup> The LORD is my high ridge, my stronghold, my deliverer. My God is my rocky summit where I take shelter, my
      shield, the horn that saves me, and my refuge.
      <sup>3</sup> I called to the LORD, who is worthy of praise, and I was delivered from my enemies.
      <sup>4</sup> The waves of death engulfed me, the currents of chaos overwhelmed me.
      <sup>5</sup> The ropes of Sheol tightened around me, the snares of death trapped me.
      <sup>6</sup> In my distress I called to the LORD; I cried out to my God. From his heavenly temple he heard my voice; he
      listened to my cry for help.
      <sup>7</sup> The earth heaved and shook; the roots of the mountains trembled; they heaved because he was angry.
      <sup>8</sup> Smoke ascended from his nose; fire devoured as it came from his mouth; he hurled down fiery coals.
      <sup>9</sup> He made the sky sink as he descended; a thick cloud was under his feet.
      <sup>10</sup> He mounted a winged angel and flew; he glided on the wings of the wind.
      <sup>11</sup> He shrouded himself in darkness, in thick rain clouds.
      <sup>12</sup> From the brightness in front of him came hail and fiery coals.
      <sup>13</sup> The LORD thundered in the sky; the sovereign One shouted.
      <sup>14</sup> He shot his arrows and scattered them, many lightning bolts and routed them.
      <sup>15</sup> The depths of the sea were exposed; the inner regions of the world were uncovered by your battle cry, LORD, by
      the powerful breath from your nose.
      <sup>16</sup> He reached down from above and took hold of me; he pulled me from the surging water.
      <sup>17</sup> He rescued me from my strong enemy, from those who hate me, for they were too strong for me.
      <sup>18</sup> They confronted me in my day of calamity, but the LORD helped me.
      <sup>19</sup> He brought me out into a wide open place; he delivered me because he was pleased with me.
      <sup>20</sup> The LORD repaid me for my godly deeds; he rewarded my blameless behavior.
      <sup>21</sup> For I have obeyed the LORD&#39;s commands; I have not rebelled against my God.
      <sup>22</sup> For I am aware of all his regulations, and I do not reject his rules.
      <sup>23</sup> I was innocent before him, and kept myself from sinning.
      <sup>24</sup> The LORD rewarded me for my godly deeds; he took notice of my blameless behavior.
      <sup>25</sup> You prove to be loyal to one who is faithful; you prove to be trustworthy to one who is innocent.
      <sup>26</sup> You prove to be reliable to one who is blameless, but you prove to be deceptive to one who is perverse.
      <sup>27</sup> For you deliver oppressed people, but you bring down those who have a proud look.
      <sup>28</sup> Indeed, you are my lamp, LORD. My God illuminates the darkness around me.
      <sup>29</sup> Indeed, with your help I can charge against an army; by my God&#39;s power I can jump over a wall.
      <sup>30</sup> The one true God acts in a faithful manner; the LORD&#39;s promise is reliable; he is a shield to all who take
      shelter in him.
      <sup>31</sup> Indeed, who is God besides the LORD? Who is a protector besides our God?
      <sup>32</sup> The one true God gives me strength; he removes the obstacles in my way.
      <sup>33</sup> He gives me the agility of a deer; he enables me to negotiate the rugged terrain.
      <sup>34</sup> He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend even the strongest bow.
      <sup>35</sup> You give me your protective shield; your right hand supports me; your willingness to help enables me to
      prevail.
      <sup>36</sup> You widen my path; my feet do not slip.
      <sup>37</sup> I chase my enemies and catch them; I do not turn back until I wipe them out.
      <sup>38</sup> I beat them to death; they fall at my feet.
      <sup>39</sup> You give me strength for battle; you make my foes kneel before me.
      <sup>40</sup> You make my enemies retreat; I destroy those who hate me.
      <sup>41</sup> They cry out, but there is no one to help them; they cry out to the LORD, but he does not answer them.
      <sup>42</sup> I grind them as fine windblown dust; I beat them underfoot like clay in the streets.
      <sup>43</sup> You rescue me from a hostile army; you make me a leader of nations; people over whom I had no authority are now
      my subjects.
      <sup>44</sup> When they hear of my exploits, they submit to me. Foreigners are powerless before me;
      <sup>45</sup> foreigners lose their courage; they shake with fear as they leave their strongholds.
      <sup>46</sup> The LORD is alive! My protector is praiseworthy! The God who delivers me is exalted as king!
      <sup>47</sup> The one true God completely vindicates me; he makes nations submit to me.
      <sup>48</sup> He delivers me from my enemies; you snatch me away from those who attack me; you rescue me from violent men.
      <sup>49</sup> So I will give you thanks before the nations, O LORD! I will sing praises to you!
      <sup>50</sup> He gives his chosen king magnificent victories; he is faithful to his chosen ruler, to David and his
      descendants forever.&quot;</p>

      <sup>1</sup> [For the music director; a psalm of David.] The heavens declare the glory of God; the sky displays his
      handiwork.

      <sup>3</sup> There is no actual speech or word, nor is its voice literally heard.
      <sup>4</sup> Yet its voice echoes throughout the earth; its words carry to the distant horizon. In the sky he has pitched a

      <sup>5</sup> Like a bridegroom it emerges from its chamber; like a strong man it enjoys running its course.
      <sup>6</sup> It emerges from the distant horizon, and goes from one end of the sky to the other; nothing can escape its heat.
      <sup>7</sup> The law of the LORD is perfect and preserves one&#39;s life. The rules set down by the LORD are reliable and
      impart wisdom to the inexperienced.
      <sup>8</sup> The LORD&#39;s precepts are fair and make one joyful. The LORD&#39;s commands are pure and give insight for
      life.
      <sup>9</sup> The commands to fear the LORD are right and endure forever. The judgments given by the LORD are trustworthy and
      absolutely just.
      <sup>10</sup> They are of greater value than gold, than even a great amount of pure gold; they bring greater delight than
      honey, than even the sweetest honey from a honeycomb.
      <sup>11</sup> Yes, your servant finds moral guidance there; those who obey them receive a rich reward.
      <sup>12</sup> Who can know all his errors? Please do not punish me for sins I am unaware of.
      <sup>13</sup> Moreover, keep me from committing flagrant sins; do not allow such sins to control me. Then I will be
      blameless, and innocent of blatant rebellion.

      <sup>3</sup> For you bring him rich blessings; you place a golden crown on his head.

      <sup>8</sup> You prevail over all your enemies; your power is too great for those who hate you.
      <sup>9</sup> You burn them up like a fiery furnace when you appear; the LORD angrily devours them; the fire consumes them.

      <sup>11</sup> Yes, they intend to do you harm; they dream up a scheme, but they do not succeed.

      <sup>2</sup> My God, I cry out during the day, but you do not answer, and during the night my prayers do not let up.
      <sup>3</sup> You are holy; you sit as king receiving the praises of Israel.
      <sup>4</sup> In you our ancestors trusted; they trusted in you and you rescued them.
      <sup>5</sup> To you they cried out, and they were saved; in you they trusted and they were not disappointed.
      <sup>6</sup> But I am a worm, not a man; people insult me and despise me.
      <sup>7</sup> All who see me taunt me; they mock me and shake their heads.
      <sup>8</sup> They say, &quot;Commit yourself to the LORD! Let the LORD rescue him! Let the LORD deliver him, for he delights
      in him.&quot;
      <sup>9</sup> Yes, you are the one who brought me out from the womb and made me feel secure on my mother&#39;s breasts.
      <sup>10</sup> I have been dependent on you since birth; from the time I came out of my mother&#39;s womb you have been my
      God.
      <sup>11</sup> Do not remain far away from me, for trouble is near and I have no one to help me.
      <sup>12</sup> Many bulls surround me; powerful bulls of Bashan hem me in.
      <sup>13</sup> They open their mouths to devour me like a roaring lion that rips its prey.
      <sup>14</sup> My strength drains away like water; all my bones are dislocated; my heart is like wax; it melts away inside me.
      <sup>15</sup> The roof of my mouth is as dry as a piece of pottery; my tongue sticks to my gums. You set me in the dust of
      death.
      <sup>16</sup> Yes, wild dogs surround me, a gang of evil men crowd around me; like a lion they pin my hands and feet.

      <sup>19</sup> But you, O LORD, do not remain far away! You are my source of strength! Hurry and help me!
      <sup>20</sup> Deliver me from the sword! Save my life from the claws of the wild dogs!
      <sup>21</sup> Rescue me from the mouth of the lion, and from the horns of the wild oxen! You have answered me!
      <sup>22</sup> I will declare your name to my countrymen! In the middle of the assembly I will praise you!
      <sup>23</sup> You loyal followers of the LORD, praise him! All you descendants of Jacob, honor him! All you descendants of
      Israel, stand in awe of him!
      <sup>24</sup> For he did not despise or detest the suffering of the oppressed; he did not ignore him; when he cried out to
      him, he responded.
      <sup>25</sup> You are the reason I offer praise in the great assembly; I will fulfill my promises before the LORD&#39;s loyal
      followers.
      <sup>26</sup> Let the oppressed eat and be filled! Let those who seek his help praise the LORD! May you live forever!
      <sup>27</sup> Let all the people of the earth acknowledge the LORD and turn to him! Let all the nations worship you!
      <sup>28</sup> For the LORD is king and rules over the nations.
      <sup>29</sup> All of the thriving people of the earth will join the celebration and worship; all those who are descending
      into the grave will bow before him, including those who cannot preserve their lives.
      <sup>30</sup> A whole generation will serve him; they will tell the next generation about the sovereign Lord.

      <sup>10</sup> For my life nears its end in pain; my years draw to a close as I groan. My strength fails me because of my sin,
      and my bones become brittle.
      <sup>11</sup> Because of all my enemies, people disdain me; my neighbors are appalled by my suffering, those who know me are
      horrified by my condition; those who see me in the street run away from me.
      <sup>12</sup> I am forgotten, like a dead man no one thinks about; I am regarded as worthless, like a broken jar.
      <sup>13</sup> For I hear what so many are saying, the terrifying news that comes from every direction. When they plot
      together against me, they figure out how they can take my life.
      <sup>14</sup> But I trust in you, O LORD! I declare, &quot;You are my God!&quot;
      <sup>15</sup> You determine my destiny! Rescue me from the power of my enemies and those who chase me.
      <sup>16</sup> Smile on your servant! Deliver me because of your faithfulness!
      <sup>17</sup> O LORD, do not let me be humiliated, for I call out to you! May evil men be humiliated! May they go wailing to
      the grave!
      <sup>18</sup> May lying lips be silenced, lips that speak defiantly against the innocent with arrogance and contempt!
      <sup>19</sup> How great is your favor, which you store up for your loyal followers! In plain sight of everyone you bestow it
      on those who take shelter in you.
      <sup>20</sup> You hide them with you, where they are safe from the attacks of men; you conceal them in a shelter, where they
      are safe from slanderous attacks.
      <sup>21</sup> The LORD deserves praise for he demonstrated his amazing faithfulness to me when I was besieged by enemies.
      <sup>22</sup> I jumped to conclusions and said, &quot;I am cut off from your presence!&quot; But you heard my plea for mercy
      when I cried out to you for help.
      <sup>23</sup> Love the LORD, all you faithful followers of his! The LORD protects those who have integrity, but he pays back
      in full the one who acts arrogantly.
      <sup>24</sup> Be strong and confident, all you who wait on the LORD!</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">32</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [By David; a well-written song.] How blessed is the one whose rebellious acts are forgiven, whose sin is
      pardoned!
      <sup>2</sup> How blessed is the one whose wrongdoing the LORD does not punish, in whose spirit there is no deceit.
      <sup>3</sup> When I refused to confess my sin, my whole body wasted away, while I groaned in pain all day long.
      <sup>4</sup> For day and night you tormented me; you tried to destroy me in the intense heat of summer. (Selah)
      <sup>5</sup> Then I confessed my sin; I no longer covered up my wrongdoing. I said, &quot;I will confess my rebellious acts
      to the LORD.&quot; And then you forgave my sins. (Selah)
      <sup>6</sup> For this reason every one of your faithful followers should pray to you while there is a window of opportunity.
      Certainly when the surging water rises, it will not reach them.
      <sup>7</sup> You are my hiding place; you protect me from distress. You surround me with shouts of joy from those celebrating
      deliverance. (Selah)
      <sup>8</sup> I will instruct and teach you about how you should live. I will advise you as I look you in the eye.
      <sup>9</sup> Do not be like an unintelligent horse or mule, which will not obey you unless they are controlled by a bridle
      and bit.
      <sup>10</sup> An evil person suffers much pain, but the LORD&#39;s faithfulness overwhelms the one who trusts in him.
      <sup>11</sup> Rejoice in the LORD and be happy, you who are godly! Shout for joy, all you who are morally upright!</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">33</a>
      <sup>1</sup> You godly ones, shout for joy because of the LORD! It is appropriate for the morally upright to offer him
      praise.
      <sup>2</sup> Give thanks to the LORD with the harp! Sing to him to the accompaniment of a ten-stringed instrument!
      <sup>3</sup> Sing to him a new song! Play skillfully as you shout out your praises to him!
      <sup>4</sup> For the LORD&#39;s decrees are just, and everything he does is fair.
      <sup>5</sup> The LORD promotes equity and justice; the LORD&#39;s faithfulness extends throughout the earth.
      <sup>6</sup> By the LORD&#39;s decree the heavens were made; by a mere word from his mouth all the stars in the sky were
      created.
      <sup>7</sup> He piles up the water of the sea; he puts the oceans in storehouses.
      <sup>8</sup> Let the whole earth fear the LORD! Let all who live in the world stand in awe of him!
      <sup>9</sup> For he spoke, and it came into existence, he issued the decree, and it stood firm.
      <sup>10</sup> The LORD frustrates the decisions of the nations; he nullifies the plans of the peoples.
      <sup>11</sup> The LORD&#39;s decisions stand forever; his plans abide throughout the ages.
      <sup>12</sup> How blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people whom he has chosen to be his special possession.
      <sup>13</sup> The LORD watches from heaven; he sees all people.
      <sup>14</sup> From the place where he lives he looks carefully at all the earth&#39;s inhabitants.
      <sup>15</sup> He is the one who forms every human heart, and takes note of all their actions.
      <sup>16</sup> No king is delivered by his vast army; a warrior is not saved by his great might.
      <sup>17</sup> A horse disappoints those who trust in it for victory; despite its great strength, it cannot deliver.
      <sup>18</sup> Look, the LORD takes notice of his loyal followers, those who wait for him to demonstrate his faithfulness
      <sup>19</sup> by saving their lives from death and sustaining them during times of famine.
      <sup>20</sup> We wait for the LORD; he is our deliverer and shield.
      <sup>21</sup> For our hearts rejoice in him, for we trust in his holy name.
      <sup>22</sup> May we experience your faithfulness, O LORD, for we wait for you.</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">34</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [Written by David, when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech, causing the king to send him away.] I will
      praise the LORD at all times; my mouth will continually praise him.
      <sup>2</sup> I will boast in the LORD; let the oppressed hear and rejoice!
      <sup>3</sup> Magnify the LORD with me! Let&#39;s praise his name together!
      <sup>4</sup> I sought the LORD&#39;s help and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears.
      <sup>5</sup> Those who look to him for help are happy; their faces are not ashamed.
      <sup>6</sup> This oppressed man cried out and the LORD heard; he saved him from all his troubles.
      <sup>7</sup> The LORD&#39;s angel camps around the LORD&#39;s loyal followers and delivers them.
      <sup>8</sup> Taste and see that the LORD is good! How blessed is the one who takes shelter in him!
      <sup>9</sup> Remain loyal to the LORD, you chosen people of his, for his loyal followers lack nothing!
      <sup>10</sup> Even young lions sometimes lack food and are hungry, but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.
      <sup>11</sup> Come children! Listen to me! I will teach you what it means to fear the LORD.
      <sup>12</sup> Do you want to really live? Would you love to live a long, happy life?
      <sup>13</sup> Then make sure you don&#39;t speak evil words or use deceptive speech!
      <sup>14</sup> Turn away from evil and do what is right! Strive for peace and promote it!
      <sup>15</sup> The LORD pays attention to the godly and hears their cry for help.
      <sup>16</sup> But the LORD opposes evildoers and wipes out all memory of them from the earth.
      <sup>17</sup> The godly cry out and the LORD hears; he saves them from all their troubles.
      <sup>18</sup> The LORD is near the brokenhearted; he delivers those who are discouraged.
      <sup>19</sup> The godly face many dangers, but the LORD saves them from each one of them.
      <sup>20</sup> He protects all his bones; not one of them is broken.
      <sup>21</sup> Evil people self-destruct; those who hate the godly are punished.
      <sup>22</sup> The LORD rescues his servants; all who take shelter in him escape punishment.</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">35</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [By David.] O LORD, fight those who fight with me! Attack those who attack me!
      <sup>2</sup> Grab your small shield and large shield, and rise up to help me!
      <sup>3</sup> Use your spear and lance against those who chase me! Assure me with these words: &quot;I am your
      deliverer!&quot;
      <sup>4</sup> May those who seek my life be embarrassed and humiliated! May those who plan to harm me be turned back and
      ashamed!
      <sup>5</sup> May they be like wind-driven chaff, as the LORD&#39;s angel attacks them!
      <sup>6</sup> May their path be dark and slippery, as the LORD&#39;s angel chases them!
      <sup>7</sup> I did not harm them, but they hid a net to catch me and dug a pit to trap me.
      <sup>8</sup> Let destruction take them by surprise! Let the net they hid catch them! Let them fall into destruction!
      <sup>9</sup> Then I will rejoice in the LORD and be happy because of his deliverance.
      <sup>10</sup> With all my strength I will say, &quot;O LORD, who can compare to you? You rescue the oppressed from those who
      try to overpower them; the oppressed and needy from those who try to rob them.&quot;
      <sup>11</sup> Violent men perjure themselves, and falsely accuse me.
      <sup>12</sup> They repay me evil for the good I have done; I am overwhelmed with sorrow.
      <sup>13</sup> When they were sick, I wore sackcloth, and refrained from eating food. (If I am lying, may my prayers go
      unanswered!)
      <sup>14</sup> I mourned for them as I would for a friend or my brother. I bowed down in sorrow as if I were mourning for my
      mother.
      <sup>15</sup> But when I stumbled, they rejoiced and gathered together; they gathered together to ambush me. They tore at me
      without stopping to rest.
      <sup>16</sup> When I tripped, they taunted me relentlessly, and tried to bite me.
      <sup>17</sup> O Lord, how long are you going to just stand there and watch this? Rescue me from their destructive attacks;
      guard my life from the young lions!
      <sup>18</sup> Then I will give you thanks in the great assembly; I will praise you before a large crowd of people!
      <sup>19</sup> Do not let those who are my enemies for no reason gloat over me! Do not let those who hate me without cause
      carry out their wicked schemes!
      <sup>20</sup> For they do not try to make peace with others, but plan ways to deceive those who are unsuspecting.
      <sup>21</sup> They are ready to devour me; they say, &quot;Aha! Aha! We&#39;ve got you!&quot;
      <sup>22</sup> But you take notice, LORD! O Lord, do not remain far away from me!
      <sup>23</sup> Rouse yourself, wake up and vindicate me! My God and Lord, defend my just cause!
      <sup>24</sup> Vindicate me by your justice, O LORD my God! Do not let them gloat over me!
      <sup>25</sup> Do not let them say to themselves, &quot;Aha! We have what we wanted!&quot; Do not let them say, &quot;We have
      devoured him!&quot;
      <sup>26</sup> May those who want to harm me be totally embarrassed and ashamed! May those who arrogantly taunt me be covered
      with shame and humiliation!
      <sup>27</sup> May those who desire my vindication shout for joy and rejoice! May they continually say, &quot;May the LORD be
      praised, for he wants his servant to be secure.&quot;
      <sup>28</sup> Then I will tell others about your justice, and praise you all day long.</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">36</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [For the music director; written by the LORD&#39;s servant, David; an oracle.] An evil man is rebellious to the
      core. He does not fear God,
      <sup>2</sup> for he is too proud to recognize and give up his sin.
      <sup>3</sup> The words he speaks are sinful and deceitful; he does not care about doing what is wise and right.
      <sup>4</sup> He plans ways to sin while he lies in bed; he is committed to a sinful lifestyle; he does not reject what is
      evil.
      <sup>5</sup> O LORD, your loyal love reaches to the sky; your faithfulness to the clouds.
      <sup>6</sup> Your justice is like the highest mountains, your fairness like the deepest sea; you preserve mankind and the
      animal kingdom.
      <sup>7</sup> How precious is your loyal love, O God! The human race finds shelter under your wings.
      <sup>8</sup> They are filled with food from your house, and you allow them to drink from the river of your delicacies.
      <sup>9</sup> For you are the one who gives and sustains life.
      <sup>10</sup> Extend your loyal love to your faithful followers, and vindicate the morally upright!
      <sup>11</sup> Do not let arrogant men overtake me, or let evil men make me homeless!
      <sup>12</sup> I can see the evildoers! They have fallen! They have been knocked down and are unable to get up!</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">37</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [By David.] Do not fret when wicked men seem to succeed! Do not envy evildoers!
      <sup>2</sup> For they will quickly dry up like grass, and wither away like plants.
      <sup>3</sup> Trust in the LORD and do what is right! Settle in the land and maintain your integrity!
      <sup>4</sup> Then you will take delight in the LORD, and he will answer your prayers.
      <sup>5</sup> Commit your future to the LORD! Trust in him, and he will act on your behalf.
      <sup>6</sup> He will vindicate you in broad daylight, and publicly defend your just cause.
      <sup>7</sup> Wait patiently for the LORD! Wait confidently for him! Do not fret over the apparent success of a sinner, a man
      who carries out wicked schemes!
      <sup>8</sup> Do not be angry and frustrated! Do not fret! That only leads to trouble!
      <sup>9</sup> Wicked men will be wiped out, but those who rely on the LORD are the ones who will possess the land.
      <sup>10</sup> Evil men will soon disappear; you will stare at the spot where they once were, but they will be gone.
      <sup>11</sup> But the oppressed will possess the land and enjoy great prosperity.
      <sup>12</sup> Evil men plot against the godly and viciously attack them.
      <sup>13</sup> The Lord laughs in disgust at them, for he knows that their day is coming.
      <sup>14</sup> Evil men draw their swords and prepare their bows, to bring down the oppressed and needy, and to slaughter
      those who are godly.
      <sup>15</sup> Their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken.
      <sup>16</sup> The little bit that a godly man owns is better than the wealth of many evil men,
      <sup>17</sup> for evil men will lose their power, but the LORD sustains the godly.
      <sup>18</sup> The LORD watches over the innocent day by day and they possess a permanent inheritance.
      <sup>19</sup> They will not be ashamed when hard times come; when famine comes they will have enough to eat.
      <sup>20</sup> But evil men will die; the LORD&#39;s enemies will be incinerated, they will go up in smoke.
      <sup>21</sup> Evil men borrow, but do not repay their debt, but the godly show compassion and are generous.
      <sup>22</sup> Surely those favored by the LORD will possess the land, but those rejected by him will be wiped out.
      <sup>23</sup> The LORD grants success to the one whose behavior he finds commendable.
      <sup>24</sup> Even if he trips, he will not fall headlong, for the LORD holds his hand.
      <sup>25</sup> I was once young, now I am old. I have never seen a godly man abandoned, or his children forced to search for
      food.
      <sup>26</sup> All day long he shows compassion and lends to others, and his children are blessed.
      <sup>27</sup> Turn away from evil! Do what is right! Then you will enjoy lasting security.
      <sup>28</sup> For the LORD promotes justice, and never abandons his faithful followers. They are permanently secure, but the
      children of evil men are wiped out.
      <sup>29</sup> The godly will possess the land and will dwell in it permanently.
      <sup>30</sup> The godly speak wise words and promote justice.
      <sup>31</sup> The law of their God controls their thinking; their feet do not slip.
      <sup>32</sup> Evil men set an ambush for the godly and try to kill them.
      <sup>33</sup> But the LORD does not surrender the godly, or allow them to be condemned in a court of law.
      <sup>34</sup> Rely on the LORD! Obey his commands! Then he will permit you to possess the land; you will see the demise of
      evil men.
      <sup>35</sup> I have seen ruthless evil men growing in influence, like a green tree grows in its native soil.
      <sup>36</sup> But then one passes by, and suddenly they have disappeared! I looked for them, but they could not be found.
      <sup>37</sup> Take note of the one who has integrity! Observe the godly! For the one who promotes peace has a future.
      <sup>38</sup> Sinful rebels are totally destroyed; evil men have no future.
      <sup>39</sup> But the LORD delivers the godly; he protects them in times of trouble.
      <sup>40</sup> The LORD helps them and rescues them; he rescues them from evil men and delivers them, for they seek his
      protection.</p>

      <sup>1</sup> [A psalm of David, written to get God&#39;s attention.] O LORD, do not continue to rebuke me in your anger! Do
      not continue to punish me in your raging fury!
      <sup>2</sup> For your arrows pierce me, and your hand presses me down.
      <sup>3</sup> My whole body is sick because of your judgment; I am deprived of health because of my sin.
      <sup>4</sup> For my sins overwhelm me; like a heavy load, they are too much for me to bear.
      <sup>5</sup> My wounds are infected and starting to smell, because of my foolish sins.
      <sup>6</sup> I am dazed and completely humiliated; all day long I walk around mourning.
      <sup>7</sup> For I am overcome with shame and my whole body is sick.
      <sup>8</sup> I am numb with pain and severely battered; I groan loudly because of the anxiety I feel.
      <sup>9</sup> O Lord, you understand my heart&#39;s desire; my groaning is not hidden from you.
      <sup>10</sup> My heart beats quickly; my strength leaves me; I can hardly see.
      <sup>11</sup> Because of my condition, even my friends and acquaintances keep their distance; my neighbors stand far away.
      <sup>12</sup> Those who seek my life try to entrap me; those who want to harm me speak destructive words; all day long they
      say deceitful things.
      <sup>13</sup> But I am like a deaf man, I hear nothing; I am like a mute who cannot speak.
      <sup>14</sup> I am like a man who cannot hear and is incapable of arguing his defense.
      <sup>15</sup> Yet I wait for you, O LORD! You will respond, O Lord, my God!
      <sup>16</sup> I have prayed for deliverance, because otherwise they will gloat over me; when my foot slips they will
      arrogantly taunt me.
      <sup>17</sup> For I am about to stumble, and I am in constant pain.
      <sup>18</sup> Yes, I confess my wrongdoing, and I am concerned about my sins.
      <sup>19</sup> But those who are my enemies for no reason are numerous; those who hate me without cause outnumber me.
      <sup>20</sup> They repay me evil for the good I have done; though I have tried to do good to them, they hurl accusations at
      me.
      <sup>21</sup> Do not abandon me, O LORD! My God, do not remain far away from me!
      <sup>22</sup> Hurry and help me, O Lord, my deliverer!</p>

      <a class="ch">39</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [For the music director, Jeduthun; a psalm of David.] I decided, &quot;I will watch what I say and make sure I
      do not sin with my tongue. I will put a muzzle over my mouth while in the presence of an evil man.&quot;
      <sup>2</sup> I was stone silent; I held back the urge to speak. My frustration grew;
      <sup>3</sup> my anxiety intensified. As I thought about it, I became impatient. Finally I spoke these words:
      <sup>4</sup> &quot;O LORD, help me understand my mortality and the brevity of life! Let me realize how quickly my life will
      pass!
      <sup>5</sup> Look, you make my days short-lived, and my life span is nothing from your perspective. Surely all people, even
      those who seem secure, are nothing but vapor.
      <sup>6</sup> Surely people go through life as mere ghosts. Surely they accumulate worthless wealth without knowing who will
      eventually haul it away.&quot;
      <sup>7</sup> But now, O Lord, upon what am I relying? You are my only hope!
      <sup>8</sup> Deliver me from all my sins of rebellion! Do not make me the object of fools&#39; insults!
      <sup>9</sup> I am silent and cannot open my mouth because of what you have done.
      <sup>10</sup> Please stop wounding me! You have almost beaten me to death!
      <sup>11</sup> You severely discipline people for their sins; like a moth you slowly devour their strength. Surely all people
      are a mere vapor. (Selah)
      <sup>12</sup> Hear my prayer, O LORD! Listen to my cry for help! Do not ignore my sobbing! For I am dependent on you, like
      one residing outside his native land; I am at your mercy, just as all my ancestors were.
      <sup>13</sup> Turn your angry gaze away from me, so I can be happy before I pass away.</p>

      <sup>1</sup> [For the music director; By David, a psalm.] I relied completely on the LORD, and he turned toward me and heard
      my cry for help.
      <sup>2</sup> He lifted me out of the watery pit, out of the slimy mud. He placed my feet on a rock and gave me secure
      footing.
      <sup>3</sup> He gave me reason to sing a new song, praising our God. May many see what God has done, so that they might swear
      allegiance to him and trust in the LORD!
      <sup>4</sup> How blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD and does not seek help from the proud or from liars!
      <sup>5</sup> O LORD, my God, you have accomplished many things; you have done amazing things and carried out your purposes
      for us. No one can thwart you! I want to declare them and talk about them, but they are too numerous to recount!
      <sup>6</sup> Receiving sacrifices and offerings are not your primary concern. You make that quite clear to me! You do not ask
      for burnt sacrifices and sin offerings.
      <sup>7</sup> Then I say, &quot;Look! I come! What is written in the scroll pertains to me.
      <sup>8</sup> I want to do what pleases you, my God. Your law dominates my thoughts.&quot;
      <sup>9</sup> I have told the great assembly about your justice. Look! I spare no words! O LORD, you know this is true.
      <sup>10</sup> I have not failed to tell about your justice; I spoke about your reliability and deliverance; I have not
      neglected to tell the great assembly about your loyal love and faithfulness.
      <sup>11</sup> O LORD, you do not withhold your compassion from me. May your loyal love and faithfulness continually protect
      me!
      <sup>12</sup> For innumerable dangers surround me. My sins overtake me so I am unable to see; they outnumber the hairs of my
      head so my strength fails me.
      <sup>13</sup> Please be willing, O LORD, to rescue me! O LORD, hurry and help me!
      <sup>14</sup> May those who are trying to snatch away my life be totally embarrassed and ashamed! May those who want to harm
      me be turned back and ashamed!
      <sup>15</sup> May those who say to me, &quot;Aha! Aha!&quot; be humiliated and disgraced!
      <sup>16</sup> May all those who seek you be happy and rejoice in you! May those who love to experience your deliverance say
      continually, &quot;May the LORD be praised!&quot;
      <sup>17</sup> I am oppressed and needy! May the Lord pay attention to me! You are my helper and my deliverer! O my God, do

      <sup>3</sup> The LORD supports him on his sickbed; you completely heal him from his illness.
      <sup>4</sup> As for me, I said: &quot;O LORD, have mercy on me! Heal me, for I have sinned against you!
      <sup>5</sup> My enemies ask this cruel question about me, &#39;When will he finally die and be forgotten?&#39;
      <sup>6</sup> When someone comes to visit, he pretends to be friendly; he thinks of ways to defame me, and when he leaves he
      slanders me.
      <sup>7</sup> All who hate me whisper insults about me to one another; they plan ways to harm me.

      <sup>9</sup> Even my close friend whom I trusted, he who shared meals with me, has turned against me.
      <sup>10</sup> As for you, O LORD, have mercy on me and raise me up, so I can pay them back!&quot;
      <sup>11</sup> By this I know that you are pleased with me, for my enemy does not triumph over me.
      <sup>12</sup> As for me, you uphold me because of my integrity; you allow me permanent access to your presence.

      <sup>1</sup> [For the music director; a well-written song by the Korahites.] As a deer longs for streams of water, so I long
      for you, O God!
      <sup>2</sup> I thirst for God, for the living God. I say, &quot;When will I be able to go and appear in God&#39;s
      presence?&quot;
      <sup>3</sup> I cannot eat, I weep day and night; all day long they say to me, &quot;Where is your God?&quot;
      <sup>4</sup> I will remember and weep! For I was once walking along with the great throng to the temple of God, shouting and
      giving thanks along with the crowd as we celebrated the holy festival.
      <sup>5</sup> Why are you depressed, O my soul? Why are you upset? Wait for God! For I will again give thanks to my God for
      his saving intervention.
      <sup>6</sup> I am depressed, so I will pray to you while I am trapped here in the region of the upper Jordan, from Hermon,
      from Mount Mizar.
      <sup>7</sup> One deep stream calls out to another at the sound of your waterfalls; all your billows and waves overwhelm me.
      <sup>8</sup> By day the LORD decrees his loyal love, and by night he gives me a song, a prayer to the living God.
      <sup>9</sup> I will pray to God, my high ridge: &quot;Why do you ignore me? Why must I walk around mourning because my
      enemies oppress me?&quot;
      <sup>10</sup> My enemies&#39; taunts cut into me to the bone, as they say to me all day long, &quot;Where is your God?&quot;

      oppress me?
      <sup>3</sup> Reveal your light and your faithfulness! They will lead me, they will escort me back to your holy hill, and to
      the place where you live.
      <sup>4</sup> Then I will go to the altar of God, to the God who gives me ecstatic joy, so that I express my thanks to you, O

      <sup>1</sup> [For the music director; by the Korahites, a well-written song.] O God, we have clearly heard; our ancestors
      have told us what you did in their days, in ancient times.
      <sup>2</sup> You, by your power, defeated nations and settled our fathers on their land; you crushed the people living there
      and enabled our ancestors to occupy it.
      <sup>3</sup> For they did not conquer the land by their swords, and they did not prevail by their strength, but rather by
      your power, strength and good favor, for you were partial to them.
      <sup>4</sup> You are my king, O God! Decree Jacob&#39;s deliverance!
      <sup>5</sup> By your power we will drive back our enemies; by your strength we will trample down our foes!
      <sup>6</sup> For I do not trust in my bow, and I do not prevail by my sword.
      <sup>7</sup> For you deliver us from our enemies; you humiliate those who hate us.
      <sup>8</sup> In God I boast all day long, and we will continually give thanks to your name. (Selah)
      <sup>9</sup> But you rejected and embarrassed us! You did not go into battle with our armies.
      <sup>10</sup> You made us retreat from the enemy. Those who hate us take whatever they want from us.
      <sup>11</sup> You handed us over like sheep to be eaten; you scattered us among the nations.
      <sup>12</sup> You sold your people for a pittance; you did not ask a high price for them.
      <sup>13</sup> You made us an object of disdain to our neighbors; those who live on our borders taunt and insult us.
      <sup>14</sup> You made us an object of ridicule among the nations; foreigners treat us with contempt.
      <sup>15</sup> All day long I feel humiliated and am overwhelmed with shame,
      <sup>16</sup> before the vindictive enemy who ridicules and insults me.
      <sup>17</sup> All this has happened to us, even though we have not rejected you or violated your covenant with us.
      <sup>18</sup> We have not been unfaithful, nor have we disobeyed your commands.
      <sup>19</sup> Yet you have battered us, leaving us a heap of ruins overrun by wild dogs; you have covered us with darkness.
      <sup>20</sup> If we had rejected our God, and spread out our hands in prayer to another god,
      <sup>21</sup> would not God discover it, for he knows one&#39;s thoughts?
      <sup>22</sup> Yet because of you we are killed all day long; we are treated like sheep at the slaughtering block.
      <sup>23</sup> Rouse yourself! Why do you sleep, O Lord? Wake up! Do not reject us forever!
      <sup>24</sup> Why do you look the other way, and ignore the way we are oppressed and mistreated?
      <sup>25</sup> For we lie in the dirt, with our bellies pressed to the ground.
      <sup>26</sup> Rise up and help us! Rescue us because of your loyal love!</p>

      is as skilled as the stylus of an experienced scribe.&quot;
      <sup>2</sup> You are the most handsome of all men! You speak in an impressive and fitting manner! For this reason God grants
      you continual blessings.
      <sup>3</sup> Strap your sword to your thigh, O warrior! Appear in your majestic splendor!
      <sup>4</sup> Appear in your majesty and be victorious! Ride forth for the sake of what is right, on behalf of justice! Then
      your right hand will accomplish mighty acts!
      <sup>5</sup> Your arrows are sharp and penetrate the hearts of the king&#39;s enemies. Nations fall at your feet.
      <sup>6</sup> Your throne, O God, is permanent. The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of justice.
      <sup>7</sup> You love justice and hate evil. For this reason God, your God has anointed you with the oil of joy, elevating
      you above your companions.
      <sup>8</sup> All your garments are perfumed with myrrh, aloes, and cassia. From the luxurious palaces comes the music of
      stringed instruments that makes you happy.
      <sup>9</sup> Princesses are among your honored guests, your bride stands at your right hand, wearing jewelry made with gold
      from Ophir.
      <sup>10</sup> Listen, O princess! Observe and pay attention! Forget your homeland and your family!
      <sup>11</sup> Then the king will be attracted by your beauty. After all, he is your master! Submit to him!
      <sup>12</sup> Rich people from Tyre will seek your favor by bringing a gift.
      <sup>13</sup> The princess looks absolutely magnificent, decked out in pearls and clothed in a brocade trimmed with gold.
      <sup>14</sup> In embroidered robes she is escorted to the king. Her attendants, the maidens of honor who follow her, are led
      before you.
      <sup>15</sup> They are bubbling with joy as they walk in procession and enter the royal palace.
      <sup>16</sup> Your sons will carry on the dynasty of your ancestors; you will make them princes throughout the land.
      <sup>17</sup> I will proclaim your greatness through the coming years, then the nations will praise you forever.</p>

      <sup>2</sup> For this reason we do not fear when the earth shakes, and the mountains tumble into the depths of the sea,
      <sup>3</sup> when its waves crash and foam, and the mountains shake before the surging sea. (Selah)
      <sup>4</sup> The river&#39;s channels bring joy to the city of God, the special, holy dwelling place of the sovereign One.
      <sup>5</sup> God lives within it, it cannot be moved. God rescues it at the break of dawn.
      <sup>6</sup> Nations are in uproar, kingdoms are overthrown. God gives a shout, the earth dissolves.
      <sup>7</sup> The LORD who commands armies is on our side! The God of Jacob is our protector! (Selah)
      <sup>8</sup> Come! Witness the exploits of the LORD, who brings devastation to the earth!
      <sup>9</sup> He brings an end to wars throughout the earth; he shatters the bow and breaks the spear; he burns the shields
      with fire.
      <sup>10</sup> He says, &quot;Stop your striving and recognize that I am God! I will be exalted over the nations! I will be
      exalted over the earth!&quot;

      <sup>3</sup> He subdued nations beneath us and countries under our feet.
      <sup>4</sup> He picked out for us a special land to be a source of pride for Jacob, whom he loves. (Selah)
      <sup>5</sup> God has ascended his throne amid loud shouts; the LORD has ascended his throne amid the blaring of ram&#39;s
      horns.
      <sup>6</sup> Sing to God! Sing! Sing to our king! Sing!
      <sup>7</sup> For God is king of the whole earth! Sing a well-written song!
      <sup>8</sup> God reigns over the nations! God sits on his holy throne!
      <sup>9</sup> The nobles of the nations assemble, along with the people of the God of Abraham, for God has authority over the

      holy hill.
      <sup>2</sup> It is lofty and pleasing to look at, a source of joy to the whole earth. Mount Zion resembles the peaks of
      Zaphon; it is the city of the great king.
      <sup>3</sup> God is in its fortresses; he reveals himself as its defender.
      <sup>4</sup> For look, the kings assemble; they advance together.
      <sup>5</sup> As soon as they see, they are shocked; they are terrified, they quickly retreat.
      <sup>6</sup> Look at them shake uncontrollably, like a woman writhing in childbirth.
      <sup>7</sup> With an east wind you shatter the large ships.
      <sup>8</sup> We heard about God&#39;s mighty deeds, now we have seen them, in the city of the LORD, the invincible Warrior,
      in the city of our God. God makes it permanently secure. (Selah)
      <sup>9</sup> We reflect on your loyal love, O God, within your temple.
      <sup>10</sup> The praise you receive as far away as the ends of the earth is worthy of your reputation, O God. You execute
      justice!
      <sup>11</sup> Mount Zion rejoices; the towns of Judah are happy, because of your acts of judgment.
      <sup>12</sup> Walk around Zion! Encircle it! Count its towers!
      <sup>13</sup> Consider its defenses! Walk through its fortresses, so you can tell the next generation about it!

      <sup>2</sup> Pay attention, all you people, both rich and poor!
      <sup>3</sup> I will declare a wise saying; I will share my profound thoughts.
      <sup>4</sup> I will learn a song that imparts wisdom; I will then sing my insightful song to the accompaniment of a harp.
      <sup>5</sup> Why should I be afraid in times of trouble, when the sinful deeds of deceptive men threaten to overwhelm me?
      <sup>6</sup> They trust in their wealth and boast in their great riches.
      <sup>7</sup> Certainly a man cannot rescue his brother; he cannot pay God an adequate ransom price
      <sup>8</sup> (the ransom price for a human life is too high, and people go to their final destiny),
      <sup>9</sup> so that he might continue to live forever and not experience death.
      <sup>10</sup> Surely one sees that even wise people die; fools and spiritually insensitive people all pass away and leave
      their wealth to others.
      <sup>11</sup> Their grave becomes their permanent residence, their eternal dwelling place. They name their lands after
      themselves,
      <sup>12</sup> but, despite their wealth, people do not last, they are like animals that perish.
      <sup>13</sup> This is the destiny of fools, and of those who approve of their philosophy. (Selah)
      <sup>14</sup> They will travel to Sheol like sheep, with death as their shepherd. The godly will rule over them when the day
      of vindication dawns; Sheol will consume their bodies and they will no longer live in impressive houses.
      <sup>15</sup> But God will rescue my life from the power of Sheol; certainly he will pull me to safety. (Selah)
      <sup>16</sup> Do not be afraid when a man becomes rich and his wealth multiplies!
      <sup>17</sup> For he will take nothing with him when he dies; his wealth will not follow him down into the grave.
      <sup>18</sup> He pronounces this blessing on himself while he is alive: &quot;May men praise you, for you have done
      well!&quot;
      <sup>19</sup> But he will join his ancestors; they will never again see the light of day.

      <sup>3</sup> Our God approaches and is not silent; consuming fire goes ahead of him and all around him a storm rages.
      <sup>4</sup> He summons the heavens above, as well as the earth, so that he might judge his people.
      <sup>5</sup> He says: &quot;Assemble my covenant people before me, those who ratified a covenant with me by sacrifice!&quot;
      <sup>6</sup> The heavens declare his fairness, for God is judge. (Selah)
      <sup>7</sup> He says: &quot;Listen my people! I am speaking! Listen Israel! I am accusing you! I am God, your God!
      <sup>8</sup> I am not condemning you because of your sacrifices, or because of your burnt sacrifices that you continually
      offer me.
      <sup>9</sup> I do not need to take a bull from your household or goats from your sheepfolds.
      <sup>10</sup> For every wild animal in the forest belongs to me, as well as the cattle that graze on a thousand hills.
      <sup>11</sup> I keep track of every bird in the hills, and the insects of the field are mine.
      <sup>12</sup> Even if I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and all it contains belong to me.
      <sup>13</sup> Do I eat the flesh of bulls? Do I drink the blood of goats?
      <sup>14</sup> Present to God a thank-offering! Repay your vows to the sovereign One!
      <sup>15</sup> Pray to me when you are in trouble! I will deliver you, and you will honor me!&quot;
      <sup>16</sup> God says this to the evildoer: &quot;How can you declare my commands, and talk about my covenant?
      <sup>17</sup> For you hate instruction and reject my words.
      <sup>18</sup> When you see a thief, you join him; you associate with men who are unfaithful to their wives.
      <sup>19</sup> You do damage with words, and use your tongue to deceive.
      <sup>20</sup> You plot against your brother; you slander your own brother.
      <sup>21</sup> When you did these things, I was silent, so you thought I was exactly like you. But now I will condemn you and
      state my case against you!
      <sup>22</sup> Carefully consider this, you who reject God! Otherwise I will rip you to shreds and no one will be able to
      rescue you.
      <sup>23</sup> Whoever presents a thank-offering honors me. To whoever obeys my commands, I will reveal my power to
      deliver.&quot;</p>

      <sup>2</sup> Wash away my wrongdoing! Cleanse me of my sin!
      <sup>3</sup> For I am aware of my rebellious acts; I am forever conscious of my sin.
      <sup>4</sup> Against you, you above all, I have sinned; I have done what is evil in your sight. So you are just when you
      confront me; you are right when you condemn me.
      <sup>5</sup> Look, I was guilty of sin from birth, a sinner the moment my mother conceived me.
      <sup>6</sup> Look, you desire integrity in the inner man; you want me to possess wisdom.
      <sup>7</sup> Sprinkle me with water and I will be pure; wash me and I will be whiter than snow.
      <sup>8</sup> Grant me the ultimate joy of being forgiven! May the bones you crushed rejoice!
      <sup>9</sup> Hide your face from my sins! Wipe away all my guilt!
      <sup>10</sup> Create for me a pure heart, O God! Renew a resolute spirit within me!
      <sup>11</sup> Do not reject me! Do not take your Holy Spirit away from me!
      <sup>12</sup> Let me again experience the joy of your deliverance! Sustain me by giving me the desire to obey!
      <sup>13</sup> Then I will teach rebels your merciful ways, and sinners will turn to you.
      <sup>14</sup> Rescue me from the guilt of murder, O God, the God who delivers me! Then my tongue will shout for joy because
      of your deliverance.
      <sup>15</sup> O Lord, give me the words! Then my mouth will praise you.
      <sup>16</sup> Certainly you do not want a sacrifice, or else I would offer it; you do not desire a burnt sacrifice.
      <sup>17</sup> The sacrifices God desires are a humble spirit, O God, a humble and repentant heart you will not reject.
      <sup>18</sup> Because you favor Zion, do what is good for her! Fortify the walls of Jerusalem!

      <sup>1</sup> [For the music director; a well-written song by David. It was written when Doeg the Edomite went and informed
      Saul: &quot;David has arrived at the home of Ahimelech.&quot;] Why do you boast about your evil plans, O powerful man?
      God&#39;s loyal love protects me all day long!
      <sup>2</sup> Your tongue carries out your destructive plans; it is as effective as a sharp razor, O deceiver.
      <sup>3</sup> You love evil more than good, lies more than speaking the truth. (Selah)
      <sup>4</sup> You love to use all the words that destroy, and the tongue that deceives.
      <sup>5</sup> Yet God will make you a permanent heap of ruins. He will scoop you up and remove you from your home; he will
      uproot you from the land of the living. (Selah)
      <sup>6</sup> When the godly see this, they will be filled with awe, and will mock the evildoer, saying:
      <sup>7</sup> &quot;Look, here is the man who would not make God his protector! He trusted in his great wealth and was
      confident about his plans to destroy others.&quot;
      <sup>8</sup> But I am like a flourishing olive tree in the house of God; I continually trust in God&#39;s loyal love.
      <sup>9</sup> I will continually thank you when you execute judgment; I will rely on you, for your loyal followers know you

      <sup>2</sup> God looks down from heaven at the human race, to see if there is anyone who is wise and seeks God.
      <sup>3</sup> Everyone rejects God; they are all morally corrupt. None of them does what is right, not even one!
      <sup>4</sup> All those who behave wickedly do not understand, those who devour my people as if they were eating bread, and do
      not call out to God.
      <sup>5</sup> They are absolutely terrified, even by things that do not normally cause fear. For God annihilates those who
      attack you. You are able to humiliate them because God has rejected them.

      <sup>11</sup> Disaster is within it; violence and deceit do not depart from its public square.

      taunts me, or else I could hide from him.
      <sup>13</sup> But it is you, a man like me, my close friend in whom I confided.
      <sup>14</sup> We would share personal thoughts with each other; in God&#39;s temple we would walk together among the crowd.

      change, and do not fear God.
      <sup>20</sup> He attacks his friends; he breaks his solemn promises to them.
      <sup>21</sup> His words are as smooth as butter, but he harbors animosity in his heart. His words seem softer than oil, but
      they are really like sharp swords.
      <sup>22</sup> Throw your burden upon the LORD, and he will sustain you. He will never allow the godly to be upended.
      <sup>23</sup> But you, O God, will bring them down to the deep Pit. Violent and deceitful people will not live even half a
      normal lifespan. But as for me, I trust in you.</p>

      <sup>1</sup> [For the music director; according to the yonath-elem-rechovim style; a prayer of David, written when the
      Philistines captured him in Gath.] Have mercy on me, O God, for men are attacking me! All day long hostile enemies are
      tormenting me.
      <sup>2</sup> Those who anticipate my defeat attack me all day long. Indeed, many are fighting against me, O Exalted One.
      <sup>3</sup> When I am afraid, I trust in you.
      <sup>4</sup> In God, I boast in his promise, in God I trust, I am not afraid. What can mere men do to me?
      <sup>5</sup> All day long they cause me trouble; they make a habit of plotting my demise.
      <sup>6</sup> They stalk and lurk; they watch my every step, as they prepare to take my life.
      <sup>7</sup> Because they are bent on violence, do not let them escape! In your anger bring down the nations, O God!
      <sup>8</sup> You keep track of my misery. Put my tears in your leather container! Are they not recorded in your scroll?
      <sup>9</sup> My enemies will turn back when I cry out to you for help; I know that God is on my side.
      <sup>10</sup> In God, I boast in his promise, in the LORD, I boast in his promise,
      <sup>11</sup> in God I trust, I am not afraid. What can mere men do to me?
      <sup>12</sup> I am obligated to fulfill the vows I made to you, O God; I will give you the thank-offerings you deserve,

      take shelter until trouble passes.
      <sup>2</sup> I cry out for help to the sovereign God, to the God who vindicates me.
      <sup>3</sup> May he send help from heaven and deliver me from my enemies who hurl insults! (Selah) May God send his loyal
      love and faithfulness!
      <sup>4</sup> I am surrounded by lions; I lie down among those who want to devour me; men whose teeth are spears and arrows,
      whose tongues are a sharp sword.
      <sup>5</sup> Rise up above the sky, O God! May your splendor cover the whole earth!
      <sup>6</sup> They have prepared a net to trap me; I am discouraged. They have dug a pit for me. They will fall into it!

      <sup>7</sup> I am determined, O God! I am determined! I will sing and praise you!
      <sup>8</sup> Awake, my soul! Awake, O stringed instrument and harp! I will wake up at dawn!
      <sup>9</sup> I will give you thanks before the nations, O Master! I will sing praises to you before foreigners!

      just decisions? Do you judge people fairly?
      <sup>2</sup> No! You plan how to do what is unjust; you deal out violence in the earth.
      <sup>3</sup> The wicked turn aside from birth; liars go astray as soon as they are born.
      <sup>4</sup> Their venom is like that of a snake, like a deaf serpent that does not hear,
      <sup>5</sup> that does not respond to the magicians, or to a skilled snake-charmer.
      <sup>6</sup> O God, break the teeth in their mouths! Smash the jawbones of the lions, O LORD!
      <sup>7</sup> Let them disappear like water that flows away! Let them wither like grass!
      <sup>8</sup> Let them be like a snail that melts away as it moves along! Let them be like stillborn babies that never see the
      sun!
      <sup>9</sup> Before the kindling is even placed under your pots, he will sweep it away along with both the raw and cooked
      meat.
      <sup>10</sup> The godly will rejoice when they see vengeance carried out; they will bathe their feet in the blood of the

      <sup>2</sup> Deliver me from evildoers! Rescue me from violent men!
      <sup>3</sup> For look, they wait to ambush me; powerful men stalk me, but not because I have rebelled or sinned, O LORD.

      <sup>5</sup> You, O LORD God, the invincible warrior, the God of Israel, rouse yourself and punish all the nations! Have no

      <sup>7</sup> Look, they hurl insults at me and openly threaten to kill me, for they say, &quot;Who hears?&quot;
      <sup>8</sup> But you, O LORD, laugh in disgust at them; you taunt all the nations.
      <sup>9</sup> You are my source of strength! I will wait for you! For God is my refuge.
      <sup>10</sup> The God who loves me will help me; God will enable me to triumph over my enemies.
      <sup>11</sup> Do not strike them dead suddenly, because then my people might forget the lesson. Use your power to make them
      homeless vagabonds and then bring them down, O Lord who shields us!
      <sup>12</sup> They speak sinful words. So let them be trapped by their own pride and by the curses and lies they speak!
      <sup>13</sup> Angrily wipe them out! Wipe them out so they vanish! Let them know that God rules in Jacob and to the ends of
      the earth! (Selah)
      <sup>14</sup> They return in the evening; they growl like a dog and prowl around outside the city.
      <sup>15</sup> They wander around looking for something to eat; they refuse to sleep until they are full.
      <sup>16</sup> As for me, I will sing about your strength; I will praise your loyal love in the morning. For you are my refuge
      and my place of shelter when I face trouble.

      Edomites in the Valley of Salt.] O God, you have rejected us. You suddenly turned on us in your anger. Please restore us!
      <sup>2</sup> You made the earth quake; you split it open. Repair its breaches, for it is ready to fall.
      <sup>3</sup> You have made your people experience hard times; you have made us drink intoxicating wine.
      <sup>4</sup> You have given your loyal followers a rallying flag, so that they might seek safety from the bow. (Selah)
      <sup>5</sup> Deliver by your power and answer me, so that the ones you love may be safe.
      <sup>6</sup> God has spoken in his sanctuary: &quot;I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem; the Valley of Succoth I will
      measure off.
      <sup>7</sup> Gilead belongs to me, as does Manasseh! Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my royal scepter.
      <sup>8</sup> Moab is my washbasin. I will make Edom serve me. I will shout in triumph over Philistia.&quot;
      <sup>9</sup> Who will lead me into the fortified city? Who will bring me to Edom?
      <sup>10</sup> Have you not rejected us, O God? O God, you do not go into battle with our armies.

      <sup>3</sup> How long will you threaten a man? All of you are murderers, as dangerous as a leaning wall or an unstable fence.

      <sup>8</sup> My soul pursues you; your right hand upholds me.
      <sup>9</sup> Enemies seek to destroy my life, but they will descend into the depths of the earth.

      <sup>17</sup> Do not ignore your servant, for I am in trouble! Answer me right away!
      <sup>18</sup> Come near me and redeem me! Because of my enemies, rescue me!
      <sup>19</sup> You know how I am insulted, humiliated and disgraced; you can see all my enemies.
      <sup>20</sup> Their insults are painful and make me lose heart; I look for sympathy, but receive none, for comforters, but
      find none.
      <sup>21</sup> They put bitter poison into my food, and to quench my thirst they give me vinegar to drink.
      <sup>22</sup> May their dining table become a trap before them! May it be a snare for that group of friends!
      <sup>23</sup> May their eyes be blinded! Make them shake violently!
      <sup>24</sup> Pour out your judgment on them! May your raging anger overtake them!
      <sup>25</sup> May their camp become desolate, their tents uninhabited!
      <sup>26</sup> For they harass the one whom you discipline; they spread the news about the suffering of those whom you punish.
      <sup>27</sup> Hold them accountable for all their sins! Do not vindicate them!
      <sup>28</sup> May their names be deleted from the scroll of the living! Do not let their names be listed with the godly!
      <sup>29</sup> I am oppressed and suffering! O God, deliver and protect me!
      <sup>30</sup> I will sing praises to God&#39;s name! I will magnify him as I give him thanks!
      <sup>31</sup> That will please the LORD more than an ox or a bull with horns and hooves.
      <sup>32</sup> The oppressed look on, let them rejoice! You who seek God, may you be encouraged!
      <sup>33</sup> For the LORD listens to the needy; he does not despise his captive people.
      <sup>34</sup> Let the heavens and the earth praise him, along with the seas and everything that swims in them!
      <sup>35</sup> For God will deliver Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah, and his people will again live in them and possess
      Zion.
      <sup>36</sup> The descendants of his servants will inherit it, and those who are loyal to him will live in it.</p>

      <sup>9</sup> Do not reject me in my old age! When my strength fails, do not abandon me!

      praises to you accompanied by a harp, O Holy One of Israel!
      <sup>23</sup> My lips will shout for joy! Yes, I will sing your praises! I will praise you when you rescue me!

      <sup>3</sup> The mountains will bring news of peace to the people, and the hills will announce justice.
      <sup>4</sup> He will defend the oppressed among the people; he will deliver the children of the poor and crush the oppressor.
      <sup>5</sup> People will fear you as long as the sun and moon remain in the sky, for generation after generation.
      <sup>6</sup> He will descend like rain on the mown grass, like showers that drench the earth.
      <sup>7</sup> During his days the godly will flourish; peace will prevail as long as the moon remains in the sky.

      <a class="ch">73</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [A psalm by Asaph.] Certainly God is good to Israel, and to those whose motives are pure!
      <sup>2</sup> But as for me, my feet almost slipped; my feet almost slid out from under me.
      <sup>3</sup> For I envied those who are proud, as I observed the prosperity of the wicked.
      <sup>4</sup> For they suffer no pain; their bodies are strong and well-fed.
      <sup>5</sup> They are immune to the trouble common to men; they do not suffer as other men do.
      <sup>6</sup> Arrogance is their necklace, and violence their clothing.
      <sup>7</sup> Their prosperity causes them to do wrong; their thoughts are sinful.
      <sup>8</sup> They mock and say evil things; they proudly threaten violence.
      <sup>9</sup> They speak as if they rule in heaven, and lay claim to the earth.
      <sup>10</sup> Therefore they have more than enough food to eat, and even suck up the water of the sea.
      <sup>11</sup> They say, &quot;How does God know what we do? Is the sovereign one aware of what goes on?&quot;
      <sup>12</sup> Take a good look! This is what the wicked are like, those who always have it so easy and get richer and richer.
      <sup>13</sup> I concluded, &quot;Surely in vain I have kept my motives pure and maintained a pure lifestyle.
      <sup>14</sup> I suffer all day long, and am punished every morning.&quot;
      <sup>15</sup> If I had publicized these thoughts, I would have betrayed your loyal followers.
      <sup>16</sup> When I tried to make sense of this, it was troubling to me.
      <sup>17</sup> Then I entered the precincts of God&#39;s temple, and understood the destiny of the wicked.
      <sup>18</sup> Surely you put them in slippery places; you bring them down to ruin.
      <sup>19</sup> How desolate they become in a mere moment! Terrifying judgments make their demise complete!
      <sup>20</sup> They are like a dream after one wakes up. O Lord, when you awake you will despise them.
      <sup>21</sup> Yes, my spirit was bitter, and my insides felt sharp pain.
      <sup>22</sup> I was ignorant and lacked insight; I was as senseless as an animal before you.
      <sup>23</sup> But I am continually with you; you hold my right hand.
      <sup>24</sup> You guide me by your wise advice, and then you will lead me to a position of honor.
      <sup>25</sup> Whom do I have in heaven but you? I desire no one but you on earth.
      <sup>26</sup> My flesh and my heart may grow weak, but God always protects my heart and gives me stability.
      <sup>27</sup> Yes, look! Those far from you die; you destroy everyone who is unfaithful to you.
      <sup>28</sup> But as for me, God&#39;s presence is all I need. I have made the sovereign LORD my shelter, as I declare all
      the things you have done.</p>

      <sup>1</sup> [A well-written song by Asaph.] Why, O God, have you permanently rejected us? Why does your anger burn against
      the sheep of your pasture?
      <sup>2</sup> Remember your people whom you acquired in ancient times, whom you rescued so they could be your very own nation,
      as well as Mount Zion, where you dwell!
      <sup>3</sup> Hurry and look at the permanent ruins, and all the damage the enemy has done to the temple!
      <sup>4</sup> Your enemies roar in the middle of your sanctuary; they set up their battle flags.
      <sup>5</sup> They invade like lumberjacks swinging their axes in a thick forest.
      <sup>6</sup> And now they are tearing down all its engravings with axes and crowbars.
      <sup>7</sup> They set your sanctuary on fire; they desecrate your dwelling place by knocking it to the ground.
      <sup>8</sup> They say to themselves, &quot;We will oppress all of them.&quot; They burn down all the places where people
      worship God in the land.
      <sup>9</sup> We do not see any signs of God&#39;s presence; there are no longer any prophets and we have no one to tell us
      how long this will last.
      <sup>10</sup> How long, O God, will the adversary hurl insults? Will the enemy blaspheme your name forever?
      <sup>11</sup> Why do you remain inactive? Intervene and destroy him!
      <sup>12</sup> But God has been my king from ancient times, performing acts of deliverance on the earth.
      <sup>13</sup> You destroyed the sea by your strength; you shattered the heads of the sea monster in the water.
      <sup>14</sup> You crushed the heads of Leviathan; you fed him to the people who live along the coast.
      <sup>15</sup> You broke open the spring and the stream; you dried up perpetually flowing rivers.
      <sup>16</sup> You established the cycle of day and night; you put the moon and sun in place.
      <sup>17</sup> You set up all the boundaries of the earth; you created the cycle of summer and winter.
      <sup>18</sup> Remember how the enemy hurls insults, O LORD, and how a foolish nation blasphemes your name!
      <sup>19</sup> Do not hand the life of your dove over to a wild animal! Do not continue to disregard the lives of your
      oppressed people!
      <sup>20</sup> Remember your covenant promises, for the dark regions of the earth are full of places where violence rules.
      <sup>21</sup> Do not let the afflicted be turned back in shame! Let the oppressed and poor praise your name!
      <sup>22</sup> Rise up, O God! Defend your honor! Remember how fools insult you all day long!
      <sup>23</sup> Do not disregard what your enemies say, or the unceasing shouts of those who defy you.</p>

      <sup>2</sup> God says, &quot;At the appointed times, I judge fairly.
      <sup>3</sup> When the earth and all its inhabitants dissolve in fear, I make its pillars secure.&quot; (Selah)
      <sup>4</sup> I say to the proud, &quot;Do not be proud,&quot; and to the wicked, &quot;Do not be so confident of victory!
      <sup>5</sup> Do not be so certain you have won! Do not speak with your head held so high!
      <sup>6</sup> For victory does not come from the east or west, or from the wilderness.
      <sup>7</sup> For God is the judge! He brings one down and exalts another.
      <sup>8</sup> For the LORD holds in his hand a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices, and pours it out. Surely all the
      wicked of the earth will slurp it up and drink it to its very last drop.&quot;
      <sup>9</sup> As for me, I will continually tell what you have done; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob!

      <sup>1</sup> [For the music director; to be accompanied by stringed instruments; a psalm of Asaph, a song.] God has revealed
      himself in Judah; in Israel his reputation is great.
      <sup>2</sup> He lives in Salem; he dwells in Zion.
      <sup>3</sup> There he shattered the arrows, the shield, the sword, and the rest of the weapons of war. (Selah)
      <sup>4</sup> You shine brightly and reveal your majesty, as you descend from the hills where you killed your prey.
      <sup>5</sup> The bravehearted were plundered; they &quot;fell asleep.&quot; All the warriors were helpless.
      <sup>6</sup> At the sound of your battle cry, O God of Jacob, both rider and horse &quot;fell asleep.&quot;
      <sup>7</sup> You are awesome! Yes, you! Who can withstand your intense anger?
      <sup>8</sup> From heaven you announced what their punishment would be. The earth was afraid and silent
      <sup>9</sup> when God arose to execute judgment, and to deliver all the oppressed of the earth. (Selah)
      <sup>10</sup> Certainly your angry judgment upon men will bring you praise; you reveal your anger in full measure.
      <sup>11</sup> Make vows to the LORD your God and repay them! Let all those who surround him bring tribute to the awesome one!
      <sup>12</sup> He humbles princes; the kings of the earth regard him as awesome.</p>

      <sup>1</sup> [For the music director, Jeduthun; a psalm of Asaph.] I will cry out to God and call for help! I will cry out to
      God and he will pay attention to me.
      <sup>2</sup> In my time of trouble I sought the Lord. I kept my hand raised in prayer throughout the night. I refused to be
      comforted.
      <sup>3</sup> I said, &quot;I will remember God while I groan; I will think about him while my strength leaves me.&quot;
      (Selah)
      <sup>4</sup> You held my eyelids open; I was troubled and could not speak.
      <sup>5</sup> I thought about the days of old, about ancient times.
      <sup>6</sup> I said, &quot;During the night I will remember the song I once sang; I will think very carefully.&quot; I tried
      to make sense of what was happening.
      <sup>7</sup> I asked, &quot;Will the Lord reject me forever? Will he never again show me his favor?
      <sup>8</sup> Has his loyal love disappeared forever? Has his promise failed forever?
      <sup>9</sup> Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has his anger stifled his compassion?&quot;
      <sup>10</sup> Then I said, &quot;I am sickened by the thought that the sovereign One might become inactive.
      <sup>11</sup> I will remember the works of the LORD. Yes, I will remember the amazing things you did long ago!
      <sup>12</sup> I will think about all you have done; I will reflect upon your deeds!&quot;
      <sup>13</sup> O God, your deeds are extraordinary! What god can compare to our great God?
      <sup>14</sup> You are the God who does amazing things; you have revealed your strength among the nations.
      <sup>15</sup> You delivered your people by your strength, the children of Jacob and Joseph. (Selah)
      <sup>16</sup> The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you and trembled. Yes, the depths of the sea shook with fear.
      <sup>17</sup> The clouds poured down rain; the skies thundered. Yes, your arrows flashed about.
      <sup>18</sup> Your thunderous voice was heard in the wind; the lightning bolts lit up the world; the earth trembled and
      shook.
      <sup>19</sup> You walked through the sea; you passed through the surging waters, but left no footprints.
      <sup>20</sup> You led your people like a flock of sheep, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</p>

      <a class="ch">78</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [A well-written song by Asaph.] Pay attention, my people, to my instruction! Listen to the words I speak!
      <sup>2</sup> I will sing a song that imparts wisdom; I will make insightful observations about the past.
      <sup>3</sup> What we have heard and learned, that which our ancestors have told us,
      <sup>4</sup> we will not hide from their descendants. We will tell the next generation about the LORD&#39;s praiseworthy
      acts, about his strength and the amazing things he has done.
      <sup>5</sup> He established a rule in Jacob; he set up a law in Israel. He commanded our ancestors to make his deeds known to
      their descendants,
      <sup>6</sup> so that the next generation, children yet to be born, might know about them. They will grow up and tell their
      descendants about them.
      <sup>7</sup> Then they will place their confidence in God. They will not forget the works of God, and they will obey his
      commands.
      <sup>8</sup> Then they will not be like their ancestors, who were a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that was
      not committed and faithful to God.
      <sup>9</sup> The Ephraimites were armed with bows, but they retreated in the day of battle.
      <sup>10</sup> They did not keep their covenant with God, and they refused to obey his law.
      <sup>11</sup> They forgot what he had done, the amazing things he had shown them.
      <sup>12</sup> He did amazing things in the sight of their ancestors, in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.
      <sup>13</sup> He divided the sea and led them across it; he made the water stand in a heap.
      <sup>14</sup> He led them with a cloud by day, and with the light of a fire all night long.
      <sup>15</sup> He broke open rocks in the wilderness, and gave them enough water to fill the depths of the sea.
      <sup>16</sup> He caused streams to flow from the rock, and made the water flow like rivers.
      <sup>17</sup> Yet they continued to sin against him, and rebelled against the sovereign One in the desert.
      <sup>18</sup> They willfully challenged God by asking for food to satisfy their appetite.
      <sup>19</sup> They insulted God, saying, &quot;Is God really able to give us food in the wilderness?
      <sup>20</sup> Yes, he struck a rock and water flowed out, streams gushed forth. But can he also give us food? Will he provide
      meat for his people?&quot;
      <sup>21</sup> When the LORD heard this, he was furious. A fire broke out against Jacob, and his anger flared up against
      Israel,
      <sup>22</sup> because they did not have faith in God, and did not trust his ability to deliver them.
      <sup>23</sup> He gave a command to the clouds above, and opened the doors in the sky.
      <sup>24</sup> He rained down manna for them to eat; he gave them the grain of heaven.
      <sup>25</sup> Man ate the food of the mighty ones. He sent them more than enough to eat.
      <sup>26</sup> He brought the east wind through the sky, and by his strength led forth the south wind.
      <sup>27</sup> He rained down meat on them like dust, birds as numerous as the sand on the seashores.
      <sup>28</sup> He caused them to fall right in the middle of their camp, all around their homes.
      <sup>29</sup> They ate until they were stuffed; he gave them what they desired.
      <sup>30</sup> They were not yet filled up, their food was still in their mouths,
      <sup>31</sup> when the anger of God flared up against them. He killed some of the strongest of them; he brought the young men
      of Israel to their knees.
      <sup>32</sup> Despite all this, they continued to sin, and did not trust him to do amazing things.
      <sup>33</sup> So he caused them to die unsatisfied and filled with terror.
      <sup>34</sup> When he struck them down, they sought his favor; they turned back and longed for God.
      <sup>35</sup> They remembered that God was their protector, and that the sovereign God was their deliverer.
      <sup>36</sup> But they deceived him with their words, and lied to him.
      <sup>37</sup> They were not really committed to him, and they were unfaithful to his covenant.
      <sup>38</sup> Yet he is compassionate. He forgives sin and does not destroy. He often holds back his anger, and does not stir
      up his fury.
      <sup>39</sup> He remembered that they were made of flesh, and were like a wind that blows past and does not return.
      <sup>40</sup> How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and insulted him in the desert!
      <sup>41</sup> They again challenged God, and offended the Holy One of Israel.
      <sup>42</sup> They did not remember what he had done, how he delivered them from the enemy,
      <sup>43</sup> when he performed his awesome deeds in Egypt, and his acts of judgment in the region of Zoan.
      <sup>44</sup> He turned their rivers into blood, and they could not drink from their streams.
      <sup>45</sup> He sent swarms of biting insects against them, as well as frogs that overran their land.
      <sup>46</sup> He gave their crops to the grasshopper, the fruit of their labor to the locust.
      <sup>47</sup> He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore-fig trees with driving rain.
      <sup>48</sup> He rained hail down on their cattle, and hurled lightning bolts down on their livestock.
      <sup>49</sup> His raging anger lashed out against them, He sent fury, rage, and trouble as messengers who bring disaster.
      <sup>50</sup> He sent his anger in full force; he did not spare them from death; he handed their lives over to destruction.
      <sup>51</sup> He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of their reproductive power in the tents of Ham.
      <sup>52</sup> Yet he brought out his people like sheep; he led them through the wilderness like a flock.
      <sup>53</sup> He guided them safely along, while the sea covered their enemies.
      <sup>54</sup> He brought them to the border of his holy land, to this mountainous land which his right hand acquired.
      <sup>55</sup> He drove the nations out from before them; he assigned them their tribal allotments and allowed the tribes of
      Israel to settle down.
      <sup>56</sup> Yet they challenged and defied the sovereign God, and did not obey his commands.
      <sup>57</sup> They were unfaithful and acted as treacherously as their ancestors; they were as unreliable as a malfunctioning
      bow.
      <sup>58</sup> They made him angry with their pagan shrines, and made him jealous with their idols.
      <sup>59</sup> God heard and was angry; he completely rejected Israel.
      <sup>60</sup> He abandoned the sanctuary at Shiloh, the tent where he lived among men.
      <sup>61</sup> He allowed the symbol of his strong presence to be captured; he gave the symbol of his splendor into the hand
      of the enemy.

      <sup>63</sup> Fire consumed their young men, and their virgins remained unmarried.
      <sup>64</sup> Their priests fell by the sword, but their widows did not weep.
      <sup>65</sup> But then the Lord awoke from his sleep; he was like a warrior in a drunken rage.
      <sup>66</sup> He drove his enemies back; he made them a permanent target for insults.
      <sup>67</sup> He rejected the tent of Joseph; he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim.
      <sup>68</sup> He chose the tribe of Judah, and Mount Zion, which he loves.
      <sup>69</sup> He made his sanctuary as enduring as the heavens above; as secure as the earth, which he established
      permanently.
      <sup>70</sup> He chose David, his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds.
      <sup>71</sup> He took him away from following the mother sheep, and made him the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and of
      Israel, his chosen nation.

      <sup>41</sup> All who pass by have robbed him; he has become an object of disdain to his neighbors.
      <sup>42</sup> You have allowed his adversaries to be victorious, and all his enemies to rejoice.

      trouble!
      <sup>16</sup> May your servants see your work! May their sons see your majesty!
      <sup>17</sup> May our sovereign God extend his favor to us! Make our endeavors successful! Yes, make them successful!</p>

      <sup>1</sup> As for you, the one who lives in the shelter of the sovereign One, and resides in the protective shadow of the
      mighty king,
      <sup>2</sup> I say this about the LORD, my shelter and my stronghold, my God in whom I trust,
      <sup>3</sup> he will certainly rescue you from the snare of the hunter and from the destructive plague.
      <sup>4</sup> He will shelter you with his wings; you will find safety under his wings. His faithfulness is like a shield or a
      protective wall.
      <sup>5</sup> You need not fear the terrors of the night, the arrow that flies by day,
      <sup>6</sup> the plague that comes in the darkness, or the disease that comes at noon.
      <sup>7</sup> Though a thousand may fall beside you, and a multitude on your right side, it will not reach you.
      <sup>8</sup> Certainly you will see it with your very own eyes, you will see the wicked paid back.
      <sup>9</sup> For you have taken refuge in the LORD, my shelter, the sovereign One.
      <sup>10</sup> No harm will overtake you; no illness will come near your home.
      <sup>11</sup> For he will order his angels to protect you in all you do.
      <sup>12</sup> They will lift you up in their hands, so you will not slip and fall on a stone.
      <sup>13</sup> You will subdue a lion and a snake; you will trample underfoot a young lion and a serpent.
      <sup>14</sup> The LORD says, &quot;Because he is devoted to me, I will deliver him; I will protect him because he is loyal to
      me.
      <sup>15</sup> When he calls out to me, I will answer him. I will be with him when he is in trouble; I will rescue him and
      bring him honor.
      <sup>16</sup> I will satisfy him with long life, and will let him see my salvation.</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">92</a>
      <sup>1</sup> [A psalm; a song for the Sabbath day.] It is fitting to thank the LORD, and to sing praises to your name, O
      sovereign One!
      <sup>2</sup> It is fitting to proclaim your loyal love in the morning, and your faithfulness during the night,
      <sup>3</sup> to the accompaniment of a ten-stringed instrument and a lyre, to the accompaniment of the meditative tone of the
      harp.
      <sup>4</sup> For you, O LORD, have made me happy by your work. I will sing for joy because of what you have done.
      <sup>5</sup> How great are your works, O LORD! Your plans are very intricate!
      <sup>6</sup> The spiritually insensitive do not recognize this; the fool does not understand this.
      <sup>7</sup> When the wicked sprout up like grass, and all the evildoers glisten, it is so that they may be annihilated.
      <sup>8</sup> But you, O LORD, reign forever!
      <sup>9</sup> Indeed, look at your enemies, O LORD! Indeed, look at how your enemies perish! All the evildoers are scattered!
      <sup>10</sup> You exalt my horn like that of a wild ox. I am covered with fresh oil.
      <sup>11</sup> I gloat in triumph over those who tried to ambush me; I hear the defeated cries of the evil foes who attacked
      me.
      <sup>12</sup> The godly grow like a palm tree; they grow high like a cedar in Lebanon.
      <sup>13</sup> Planted in the LORD&#39;s house, they grow in the courts of our God.
      <sup>14</sup> They bear fruit even when they are old; they are filled with vitality and have many leaves.
      <sup>15</sup> So they proclaim that the LORD, my protector, is just and never unfair.</p>
      <p>
      <a class="ch">93</a>
      <sup>1</sup> The LORD reigns! He is robed in majesty, the LORD is robed, he wears strength around his waist. Indeed, the
      world is established, it cannot be moved.
      <sup>2</sup> Your throne has been secure from ancient times; you have always been king.
      <sup>3</sup> The waves roar, O LORD, the waves roar, the waves roar and crash.
      <sup>4</sup> Above the sound of the surging water, and the mighty waves of the sea, the LORD sits enthroned in majesty.
      <sup>5</sup> The rules you set down are completely reliable. Holiness aptly adorns your house, O LORD, forever.</p>

      <a class="ch">94</a>
      <sup>1</sup> O LORD, the God who avenges! O God who avenges, reveal your splendor!
      <sup>2</sup> Rise up, O judge of the earth! Pay back the proud!
      <sup>3</sup> O LORD, how long will the wicked, how long will the wicked celebrate?
      <sup>4</sup> They spew out threats and speak defiantly; all the evildoers boast.
      <sup>5</sup> O LORD, they crush your people; they oppress the nation that belongs to you.
      <sup>6</sup> They kill the widow and the one residing outside his native land, and they murder the fatherless.
      <sup>7</sup> Then they say, &quot;The LORD does not see this; the God of Jacob does not take notice of it.&quot;
      <sup>8</sup> Take notice of this, you ignorant people! You fools, when will you ever understand?
      <sup>9</sup> Does the one who makes the human ear not hear? Does the one who forms the human eye not see?
      <sup>10</sup> Does the one who disciplines the nations not punish? He is the one who imparts knowledge to human beings!
      <sup>11</sup> The LORD knows that peoples&#39; thoughts are morally bankrupt.
      <sup>12</sup> How blessed is the one whom you instruct, O LORD, the one whom you teach from your law,
      <sup>13</sup> in order to protect him from times of trouble, until the wicked are destroyed.
      <sup>14</sup> Certainly the LORD does not forsake his people; he does not abandon the nation that belongs to him.
      <sup>15</sup> For justice will prevail, and all the morally upright will be vindicated.
      <sup>16</sup> Who will rise up to defend me against the wicked? Who will stand up for me against the evildoers?
      <sup>17</sup> If the LORD had not helped me, I would have laid down in the silence of death.
      <sup>18</sup> If I say, &quot;My foot is slipping,&quot; your loyal love, O LORD, supports me.
      <sup>19</sup> When worries threaten to overwhelm me, your soothing touch makes me happy.
      <sup>20</sup> Cruel rulers are not your allies, those who make oppressive laws.
      <sup>21</sup> They conspire against the blameless, and condemn to death the innocent.
      <sup>22</sup> But the LORD will protect me, and my God will shelter me.
      <sup>23</sup> He will pay them back for their sin. He will destroy them because of their evil; the LORD our God will destroy
      them.</p>

      <sup>1</sup> Come! Let&#39;s sing for joy to the LORD! Let&#39;s shout out praises to our protector who delivers us!
      <sup>2</sup> Let&#39;s enter his presence with thanksgiving! Let&#39;s shout out to him in celebration!
      <sup>3</sup> For the LORD is a great God, a great king who is superior to all gods.
      <sup>4</sup> The depths of the earth are in his hand, and the mountain peaks belong to him.
      <sup>5</sup> The sea is his, for he made it. His hands formed the dry land.
      <sup>6</sup> Come! Let&#39;s bow down and worship! Let&#39;s kneel before the LORD, our creator!
      <sup>7</sup> For he is our God; we are the people of his pasture, the sheep he owns. Today, if only you would obey him!
      <sup>8</sup> He says, &quot;Do not be stubborn like they were at Meribah, like they were that day at Massah in the
      wilderness,
      <sup>9</sup> where your ancestors challenged my authority, and tried my patience, even though they had seen my work.
      <sup>10</sup> For forty years I was continually disgusted with that generation, and I said, &#39;These people desire to go
      astray; they do not obey my commands.&#39;
      <sup>11</sup> So I made a vow in my anger, &#39;They will never enter into the resting place I had set aside for
      them.&#39;&quot;</p>

      <sup>3</sup> Tell the nations about his splendor! Tell all the nations about his amazing deeds!
      <sup>4</sup> For the LORD is great and certainly worthy of praise; he is more awesome than all gods.
      <sup>5</sup> For all the gods of the nations are worthless, but the LORD made the sky.
      <sup>6</sup> Majestic splendor emanates from him; his sanctuary is firmly established and beautiful.
      <sup>7</sup> Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the nations, ascribe to the LORD splendor and strength!
      <sup>8</sup> Ascribe to the LORD the splendor he deserves! Bring an offering and enter his courts!
      <sup>9</sup> Worship the LORD in holy attire! Tremble before him, all the earth!
      <sup>10</sup> Say among the nations, &quot;The LORD reigns! The world is established, it cannot be moved. He judges the
      nations fairly.&quot;
      <sup>11</sup> Let the sky rejoice, and the earth be happy! Let the sea and everything in it shout!
      <sup>12</sup> Let the fields and everything in them celebrate! Then let the trees of the forest shout with joy
      <sup>13</sup> before the LORD, for he comes! For he comes to judge the earth! He judges the world fairly, and the nations in
      accordance with his justice.</p>

      <a class="ch">97</a>
      <sup>1</sup> The LORD reigns! Let the earth be happy! Let the many coastlands rejoice!
      <sup>2</sup> Dark clouds surround him; equity and justice are the foundation of his throne.
      <sup>3</sup> Fire goes before him; on every side it burns up his enemies.
      <sup>4</sup> His lightning bolts light up the world; the earth sees and trembles.
      <sup>5</sup> The mountains melt like wax before the LORD, before the Lord of the whole earth.
      <sup>6</sup> The sky declares his justice, and all the nations see his splendor.
      <sup>7</sup> All who worship idols are ashamed, those who boast about worthless idols. All the gods bow down before him.
      <sup>8</sup> Zion hears and rejoices, the towns of Judah are happy, because of your judgments, O LORD.
      <sup>9</sup> For you, O LORD, are the sovereign king over the whole earth; you are elevated high above all gods.
      <sup>10</sup> You who love the LORD, hate evil! He protects the lives of his faithful followers; he delivers them from the
      power of the wicked.
      <sup>11</sup> The godly bask in the light; the morally upright experience joy.
      <sup>12</sup> You godly ones, rejoice in the LORD! Give thanks to his holy name.</p>

      <sup>3</sup> He remains loyal and faithful to the family of Israel. All the ends of the earth see our God deliver us.
      <sup>4</sup> Shout out praises to the LORD, all the earth! Break out in a joyful shout and sing!
      <sup>5</sup> Sing to the LORD accompanied by a harp, accompanied by a harp and the sound of music!
      <sup>6</sup> With trumpets and the blaring of the ram&#39;s horn, shout out praises before the king, the LORD!
      <sup>7</sup> Let the sea and everything in it shout, along with the world and those who live in it!
      <sup>8</sup> Let the rivers clap their hands! Let the mountains sing in unison

      and equity in Jacob.
      <sup>5</sup> Praise the LORD our God! Worship before his footstool! He is holy!
      <sup>6</sup> Moses and Aaron were among his priests; Samuel was one of those who prayed to him. They prayed to the LORD and
      he answered them.
      <sup>7</sup> He spoke to them from a pillar of cloud; they obeyed his regulations and the ordinance he gave them.
      <sup>8</sup> O LORD our God, you answered them. They found you to be a forgiving God, but also one who punished their sinful
      deeds.

      <sup>4</sup> I will have nothing to do with a perverse person; I will not permit evil.
      <sup>5</sup> I will destroy anyone who slanders his neighbor in secret. I will not tolerate anyone who has a cocky demeanor
      and an arrogant attitude.
      <sup>6</sup> I will favor the honest people of the land, and allow them to live with me. Those who walk in the way of
      integrity will attend me.
      <sup>7</sup> Deceitful people will not live in my palace. Liars will not be welcome in my presence.

      <sup>3</sup> For my days go up in smoke, and my bones are charred like a fireplace.
      <sup>4</sup> My heart is parched and withered like grass, for I am unable to eat food.
      <sup>5</sup> Because of the anxiety that makes me groan, my bones protrude from my skin.
      <sup>6</sup> I am like an owl in the wilderness; I am like a screech owl among the ruins.
      <sup>7</sup> I stay awake; I am like a solitary bird on a roof.
      <sup>8</sup> All day long my enemies taunt me; those who mock me use my name in their curses.
      <sup>9</sup> For I eat ashes as if they were bread, and mix my drink with my tears,
      <sup>10</sup> because of your anger and raging fury. Indeed, you pick me up and throw me away.
      <sup>11</sup> My days are coming to an end, and I am withered like grass.
      <sup>12</sup> But you, O LORD, rule forever, and your reputation endures.
      <sup>13</sup> You will rise up and have compassion on Zion. For it is time to have mercy on her, for the appointed time has
      come.
      <sup>14</sup> Indeed, your servants take delight in her stones, and feel compassion for the dust of her ruins.
      <sup>15</sup> The nations will respect the reputation of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth will respect his splendor,
      <sup>16</sup> when the LORD rebuilds Zion, and reveals his splendor,
      <sup>17</sup> when he responds to the prayer of the destitute, and does not reject their request.
      <sup>18</sup> The account of his intervention will be recorded for future generations; people yet to be born will praise the
      LORD.
      <sup>19</sup> For he will look down from his sanctuary above; from heaven the LORD will look toward earth,
      <sup>20</sup> in order to hear the painful cries of the prisoners, and to set free those condemned to die,
      <sup>21</sup> so they may proclaim the name of the LORD in Zion, and praise him in Jerusalem,
      <sup>22</sup> when the nations gather together, and the kingdoms pay tribute to the LORD.
      <sup>23</sup> He has taken away my strength in the middle of life; he has cut short my days.
      <sup>24</sup> I say, &quot;O my God, please do not take me away in the middle of my life! You endure through all generations.
      <sup>25</sup> In earlier times you established the earth; the skies are your handiwork.
      <sup>26</sup> They will perish, but you will endure. They will wear out like a garment; like clothes you will remove them and

      <sup>5</sup> who satisfies your life with good things, so your youth is renewed like an eagle&#39;s.
      <sup>6</sup> The LORD does what is fair, and executes justice for all the oppressed.
      <sup>7</sup> The LORD revealed his faithful acts to Moses, his deeds to the Israelites.
      <sup>8</sup> The LORD is compassionate and merciful; he is patient and demonstrates great loyal love.
      <sup>9</sup> He does not always accuse, and does not stay angry.
      <sup>10</sup> He does not deal with us as our sins deserve; he does not repay us as our misdeeds deserve.
      <sup>11</sup> For as the skies are high above the earth, so his loyal love towers over his faithful followers.
      <sup>12</sup> As far as the eastern horizon is from the west, so he removes the guilt of our rebellious actions from us.
      <sup>13</sup> As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on his faithful followers.
      <sup>14</sup> For he knows what we are made of; he realizes we are made of clay.
      <sup>15</sup> A person&#39;s life is like grass. Like a flower in the field it flourishes,
      <sup>16</sup> but when the hot wind blows by, it disappears, and one can no longer even spot the place where it once grew.
      <sup>17</sup> But the LORD continually shows loyal love to his faithful followers, and is faithful to their descendants,

      <sup>1</sup> Praise the LORD, O my soul! O LORD my God, you are magnificent. You are robed in splendor and majesty.
      <sup>2</sup> He covers himself with light as if it were a garment. He stretches out the skies like a tent curtain,
      <sup>3</sup> and lays the beams of the upper rooms of his palace on the rain clouds. He makes the clouds his chariot, and
      travels along on the wings of the wind.
      <sup>4</sup> He makes the winds his messengers, and the flaming fire his attendant.
      <sup>5</sup> He established the earth on its foundations; it will never be upended.
      <sup>6</sup> The watery deep covered it like a garment; the waters reached above the mountains.
      <sup>7</sup> Your shout made the waters retreat; at the sound of your thunderous voice they hurried off,
      <sup>8</sup> as the mountains rose up, and the valleys went down, to the place you appointed for them.
      <sup>9</sup> You set up a boundary for them that they could not cross, so that they would not cover the earth again.
      <sup>10</sup> He turns springs into streams; they flow between the mountains.
      <sup>11</sup> They provide water for all the animals in the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
      <sup>12</sup> The birds of the sky live beside them; they chirp among the bushes.
      <sup>13</sup> He waters the mountains from the upper rooms of his palace; the earth is full of the fruit you cause to grow.
      <sup>14</sup> He provides grass for the cattle, and crops for people to cultivate, so they can produce food from the ground,
      <sup>15</sup> as well as wine that makes people feel so good, and so they can have oil to make their faces shine, as well as
      food that sustains people&#39;s lives.
      <sup>16</sup> The trees of the LORD receive all the rain they need, the cedars of Lebanon which he planted,
      <sup>17</sup> where the birds make nests, near the evergreens in which the herons live.
      <sup>18</sup> The wild goats live in the high mountains; the rock badgers find safety in the cliffs.
      <sup>19</sup> He made the moon to mark the months, and the sun sets according to a regular schedule.
      <sup>20</sup> You make it dark and night comes, during which all the beasts of the forest prowl around.
      <sup>21</sup> The lions roar for prey, seeking their food from God.
      <sup>22</sup> When the sun rises, they withdraw and sleep in their dens.
      <sup>23</sup> Men then go out to do their work, and labor away until evening.
      <sup>24</sup> How many living things you have made, O LORD! You have exhibited great skill in making all of them; the earth
      is full of the living things you have made.
      <sup>25</sup> Over here is the deep, wide sea, which teems with innumerable swimming creatures, living things both small and
      large.
      <sup>26</sup> The ships travel there, and over here swims the whale you made to play in it.
      <sup>27</sup> All of your creatures wait for you to provide them with food on a regular basis.
      <sup>28</sup> You give food to them and they receive it; you open your hand and they are filled with food.
      <sup>29</sup> When you ignore them, they panic. When you take away their life&#39;s breath, they die and return to dust.
      <sup>30</sup> When you send your life-giving breath, they are created, and you replenish the surface of the ground.
      <sup>31</sup> May the splendor of the LORD endure! May the LORD find pleasure in the living things he has made!
      <sup>32</sup> He looks down on the earth and it shakes; he touches the mountains and they start to smolder.
      <sup>33</sup> I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God as long as I exist!
      <sup>34</sup> May my thoughts be pleasing to him! I will rejoice in the LORD.

      <sup>14</sup> He let no one oppress them; he disciplined kings for their sake,
      <sup>15</sup> saying, &quot;Don&#39;t touch my chosen ones! Don&#39;t harm my prophets!&quot;
      <sup>16</sup> He called down a famine upon the earth; he cut off all the food supply.
      <sup>17</sup> He sent a man ahead of them, Joseph was sold as a servant.
      <sup>18</sup> The shackles hurt his feet; his neck was placed in an iron collar,
      <sup>19</sup> until the time when his prediction came true. The LORD&#39;s word proved him right.
      <sup>20</sup> The king authorized his release; the ruler of nations set him free.
      <sup>21</sup> He put him in charge of his palace, and made him manager of all his property,
      <sup>22</sup> giving him authority to imprison his officials and to teach his advisers.
      <sup>23</sup> Israel moved to Egypt; Jacob lived for a time in the land of Ham.
      <sup>24</sup> The LORD made his people very fruitful, and made them more numerous than their enemies.
      <sup>25</sup> He caused them to hate his people, and to mistreat his servants.
      <sup>26</sup> He sent his servant Moses, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
      <sup>27</sup> They executed his miraculous signs among them, and his amazing deeds in the land of Ham.
      <sup>28</sup> He made it dark; they did not disobey his orders.
      <sup>29</sup> He turned their water into blood, and killed their fish.
      <sup>30</sup> Their land was overrun by frogs, which even got into the rooms of their kings.
      <sup>31</sup> He ordered flies to come; gnats invaded their whole territory.
      <sup>32</sup> He sent hail along with the rain; there was lightning in their land.
      <sup>33</sup> He destroyed their vines and fig trees, and broke the trees throughout their territory.
      <sup>34</sup> He ordered locusts to come, innumerable grasshoppers.
      <sup>35</sup> They ate all the vegetation in their land, and devoured the crops of their fields.
      <sup>36</sup> He struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of their reproductive power.
      <sup>37</sup> He brought his people out enriched with silver and gold; none of his tribes stumbled.
      <sup>38</sup> Egypt was happy when they left, for they were afraid of them.
      <sup>39</sup> He spread out a cloud for a cover, and provided a fire to light up the night.
      <sup>40</sup> They asked for food, and he sent quails; he satisfied them with food from the sky.
      <sup>41</sup> He opened up a rock and water flowed out; a river ran through dry regions.
      <sup>42</sup> Yes, he remembered the sacred promise he made to Abraham his servant.
      <sup>43</sup> When he led his people out, they rejoiced; his chosen ones shouted with joy.
      <sup>44</sup> He handed the territory of nations over to them, and they took possession of what other peoples had produced,
      <sup>45</sup> so that they might keep his commands and obey his laws. Praise the LORD!</p>

      <a class="ch">106</a>
      <sup>1</sup> Praise the LORD! Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, and his loyal love endures!
      <sup>2</sup> Who can adequately recount the LORD&#39;s mighty acts, or relate all his praiseworthy deeds?
      <sup>3</sup> How blessed are those who promote justice, and do what is right all the time!
      <sup>4</sup> Remember me, O LORD, when you show favor to your people! Pay attention to me, when you deliver,
      <sup>5</sup> so I may see the prosperity of your chosen ones, rejoice along with your nation, and boast along with the people
      who belong to you.
      <sup>6</sup> We have sinned like our ancestors; we have done wrong, we have done evil.
      <sup>7</sup> Our ancestors in Egypt failed to appreciate your miraculous deeds, they failed to remember your many acts of
      loyal love, and they rebelled at the sea, by the Red Sea.
      <sup>8</sup> Yet he delivered them for the sake of his reputation, that he might reveal his power.
      <sup>9</sup> He shouted at the Red Sea and it dried up; he led them through the deep water as if it were a desert.
      <sup>10</sup> He delivered them from the power of the one who hated them, and rescued them from the power of the enemy.
      <sup>11</sup> The water covered their enemies; not even one of them survived.
      <sup>12</sup> They believed his promises; they sang praises to him.
      <sup>13</sup> They quickly forgot what he had done; they did not wait for his instructions.
      <sup>14</sup> In the wilderness they had an insatiable craving for meat; they challenged God in the desert.
      <sup>15</sup> He granted their request, then struck them with a disease.
      <sup>16</sup> In the camp they resented Moses, and Aaron, the LORD&#39;s holy priest.
      <sup>17</sup> The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it engulfed the group led by Abiram.
      <sup>18</sup> Fire burned their group; the flames scorched the wicked.
      <sup>19</sup> They made an image of a calf at Horeb, and worshiped a metal idol.
      <sup>20</sup> They traded their majestic God for the image of an ox that eats grass.
      <sup>21</sup> They rejected the God who delivered them, the one who performed great deeds in Egypt,
      <sup>22</sup> amazing feats in the land of Ham, mighty acts by the Red Sea.
      <sup>23</sup> He threatened to destroy them, but Moses, his chosen one, interceded with him and turned back his destructive
      anger.
      <sup>24</sup> They rejected the fruitful land; they did not believe his promise.
      <sup>25</sup> They grumbled in their tents; they did not obey the LORD.
      <sup>26</sup> So he made a solemn vow that he would make them die in the desert,
      <sup>27</sup> make their descendants die among the nations, and scatter them among foreign lands.
      <sup>28</sup> They worshiped Baal of Peor, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead.
      <sup>29</sup> They made the LORD angry by their actions, and a plague broke out among them.
      <sup>30</sup> Phinehas took a stand and intervened, and the plague subsided.
      <sup>31</sup> This brought him a reward, an eternal gift.
      <sup>32</sup> They made him angry by the waters of Meribah, and Moses suffered because of them,
      <sup>33</sup> for they aroused his temper, and he spoke rashly.
      <sup>34</sup> They did not destroy the nations, as the LORD had commanded them to do.
      <sup>35</sup> They mixed in with the nations and learned their ways.
      <sup>36</sup> They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them.
      <sup>37</sup> They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons.
      <sup>38</sup> They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.
      The land was polluted by bloodshed.
      <sup>39</sup> They were defiled by their deeds, and unfaithful in their actions.
      <sup>40</sup> So the LORD was angry with his people and despised the people who belong to him.
      <sup>41</sup> He handed them over to the nations, and those who hated them ruled over them.
      <sup>42</sup> Their enemies oppressed them; they were subject to their authority.
      <sup>43</sup> Many times he delivered them, but they had a rebellious attitude, and degraded themselves by their sin.
      <sup>44</sup> Yet he took notice of their distress, when he heard their cry for help.
      <sup>45</sup> He remembered his covenant with them, and relented because of his great loyal love.
      <sup>46</sup> He caused all their conquerors to have pity on them.
      <sup>47</sup> Deliver us, O LORD, our God! Gather us from among the nations! Then we will give thanks to your holy name, and
      boast about your praiseworthy deeds.
      <sup>48</sup> The LORD God of Israel deserves praise, in the future and forevermore. Let all the people say, &quot;We agree!
      Praise the LORD!&quot; Book 5 (Psalms 107-150)</p>

      <a class="ch">107</a>
      <sup>1</sup> Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, and his loyal love endures!
      <sup>2</sup> Let those delivered by the LORD speak out, those whom he delivered from the power of the enemy,
      <sup>3</sup> and gathered from foreign lands, from east and west, from north and south.
      <sup>4</sup> They wandered through the wilderness on a desert road; they found no city in which to live.
      <sup>5</sup> They were hungry and thirsty; they fainted from exhaustion.
      <sup>6</sup> They cried out to the LORD in their distress; he delivered them from their troubles.
      <sup>7</sup> He led them on a level road, that they might find a city in which to live.
      <sup>8</sup> Let them give thanks to the LORD for his loyal love, and for the amazing things he has done for people!
      <sup>9</sup> For he has satisfied those who thirst, and those who hunger he has filled with food.
      <sup>10</sup> They sat in utter darkness, bound in painful iron chains,
      <sup>11</sup> because they had rebelled against God&#39;s commands, and rejected the instructions of the sovereign king.
      <sup>12</sup> So he used suffering to humble them; they stumbled and no one helped them up.
      <sup>13</sup> They cried out to the LORD in their distress; he delivered them from their troubles.
      <sup>14</sup> He brought them out of the utter darkness, and tore off their shackles.
      <sup>15</sup> Let them give thanks to the LORD for his loyal love, and for the amazing things he has done for people!
      <sup>16</sup> For he shattered the bronze gates, and hacked through the iron bars.
      <sup>17</sup> They acted like fools in their rebellious ways, and suffered because of their sins.
      <sup>18</sup> They lost their appetite for all food, and they drew near the gates of death.
      <sup>19</sup> They cried out to the LORD in their distress; he delivered them from their troubles.
      <sup>20</sup> He sent them an assuring word and healed them; he rescued them from the pits where they were trapped.
      <sup>21</sup> Let them give thanks to the LORD for his loyal love, and for the amazing things he has done for people!
      <sup>22</sup> Let them present thank offerings, and loudly proclaim what he has done!
      <sup>23</sup> Some traveled on the sea in ships, and carried cargo over the vast waters.
      <sup>24</sup> They witnessed the acts of the LORD, his amazing feats on the deep water.
      <sup>25</sup> He gave the order for a windstorm, and it stirred up the waves of the sea.
      <sup>26</sup> They reached up to the sky, then dropped into the depths. The sailors&#39; strength left them because the
      danger was so great.
      <sup>27</sup> They swayed and staggered like a drunk, and all their skill proved ineffective.
      <sup>28</sup> They cried out to the LORD in their distress; he delivered them from their troubles.
      <sup>29</sup> He calmed the storm, and the waves grew silent.
      <sup>30</sup> The sailors rejoiced because the waves grew quiet, and he led them to the harbor they desired.
      <sup>31</sup> Let them give thanks to the LORD for his loyal love, and for the amazing things he has done for people!
      <sup>32</sup> Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people! Let them praise him in the place where the leaders preside!
      <sup>33</sup> He turned streams into a desert, springs of water into arid land,
      <sup>34</sup> and a fruitful land into a barren place, because of the sin of its inhabitants.
      <sup>35</sup> As for his people, he turned a desert into a pool of water, and a dry land into springs of water.
      <sup>36</sup> He allowed the hungry to settle there, and they established a city in which to live.
      <sup>37</sup> They cultivated fields, and planted vineyards, which yielded a harvest of fruit.
      <sup>38</sup> He blessed them so that they became very numerous. He would not allow their cattle to decrease in number.
      <sup>39</sup> As for their enemies, they decreased in number and were beaten down, because of painful distress and suffering.
      <sup>40</sup> He would pour contempt upon princes, and he made them wander in a wasteland with no road.
      <sup>41</sup> Yet he protected the needy from oppression, and cared for his families like a flock of sheep.
      <sup>42</sup> When the godly see this, they rejoice, and every sinner shuts his mouth.
      <sup>43</sup> Whoever is wise, let him take note of these things! Let them consider the LORD&#39;s acts of loyal love!</p>

      <sup>3</sup> I will give you thanks before the nations, O LORD! I will sing praises to you before foreigners!

      <sup>5</sup> Rise up above the sky, O God! May your splendor cover the whole earth!
      <sup>6</sup> Deliver by your power and answer me, so that the ones you love may be safe.
      <sup>7</sup> God has spoken in his sanctuary: &quot;I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem, the valley of Succoth I will

      <sup>8</sup> Gilead belongs to me, as does Manasseh! Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my royal scepter.

      <sup>10</sup> Who will lead me into the fortified city? Who will bring me to Edom?
      <sup>11</sup> Have you not rejected us, O God? O God, you do not go into battle with our armies.

      <sup>3</sup> They surround me and say hateful things; they attack me for no reason.
      <sup>4</sup> They repay my love with accusations, but I continue to pray.
      <sup>5</sup> They repay me evil for good, and hate for love.
      <sup>6</sup> Appoint an evil man to testify against him! May an accuser stand at his right side!
      <sup>7</sup> When he is judged, he will be found guilty! Then his prayer will be regarded as sinful.
      <sup>8</sup> May his days be few! May another take his job!
      <sup>9</sup> May his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow!
      <sup>10</sup> May his children roam around begging, asking for handouts as they leave their ruined home!
      <sup>11</sup> May the creditor seize all he owns! May strangers loot his property!
      <sup>12</sup> May no one show him kindness! May no one have compassion on his fatherless children!
      <sup>13</sup> May his descendants be cut off! May the memory of them be wiped out by the time the next generation arrives!
      <sup>14</sup> May his ancestors&#39; sins be remembered by the LORD! May his mother&#39;s sin not be forgotten!
      <sup>15</sup> May the LORD be constantly aware of them, and cut off the memory of his children from the earth!
      <sup>16</sup> For he never bothered to show kindness; he harassed the oppressed and needy, and killed the disheartened.
      <sup>17</sup> He loved to curse others, so those curses have come upon him. He had no desire to bless anyone, so he has
      experienced no blessings.
      <sup>18</sup> He made cursing a way of life, so curses poured into his stomach like water and seeped into his bones like oil.
      <sup>19</sup> May a curse attach itself to him, like a garment one puts on, or a belt one wears continually!
      <sup>20</sup> May the LORD repay my accusers in this way, those who say evil things about me!
      <sup>21</sup> O sovereign LORD, intervene on my behalf for the sake of your reputation! Because your loyal love is good,
      deliver me!
      <sup>22</sup> For I am oppressed and needy, and my heart beats violently within me.
      <sup>23</sup> I am fading away like a shadow at the end of the day; I am shaken off like a locust.
      <sup>24</sup> I am so starved my knees shake; I have turned into skin and bones.
      <sup>25</sup> I am disdained by them. When they see me, they shake their heads.
      <sup>26</sup> Help me, O LORD my God! Because you are faithful to me, deliver me!
      <sup>27</sup> Then they will realize this is your work, and that you, LORD, have accomplished it.
      <sup>28</sup> They curse, but you will bless. When they attack, they will be humiliated, but your servant will rejoice.
      <sup>29</sup> My accusers will be covered with shame, and draped in humiliation as if it were a robe.
      <sup>30</sup> I will thank the LORD profusely, in the middle of a crowd I will praise him,

      <sup>8</sup> His resolve is firm; he will not succumb to fear before he looks in triumph on his enemies.
      <sup>9</sup> He generously gives to the needy; his integrity endures. He will be vindicated and honored.

      the LORD I pushed them away.
      <sup>13</sup> &quot;You aggressively attacked me and tried to knock me down, but the LORD helped me.

      <sup>16</sup> the LORD&#39;s right hand gives victory, the LORD&#39;s right hand conquers.
      <sup>17</sup> I will not die, but live, and I will proclaim what the LORD has done.
      <sup>18</sup> The LORD severely punished me, but he did not hand me over to death.
      <sup>19</sup> Open for me the gates of the just king&#39;s temple! I will enter through them and give thanks to the LORD.
      <sup>20</sup> This is the LORD&#39;s gate, the godly enter through it.
      <sup>21</sup> I will give you thanks, for you answered me, and have become my deliverer.

      <sup>24</sup> This is the day the LORD has brought about. We will be happy and rejoice in it.
      <sup>25</sup> Please LORD, deliver! Please LORD, grant us success!
      <sup>26</sup> May the one who comes in the name of the LORD be blessed! We will pronounce blessings on you in the LORD&#39;s

      <sup>116</sup> Sustain me as you promised, so that I will live. Do not disappoint me!
      <sup>117</sup> Support me, so that I will be delivered. Then I will focus on your statutes continually.
      <sup>118</sup> You despise all who stray from your statutes, for they are deceptive and unreliable.
      <sup>119</sup> You remove all the wicked of the earth like slag. Therefore I love your rules.
      <sup>120</sup> My body trembles because I fear you; I am afraid of your judgments.&amp;u05E2; (Ayin)
      <sup>121</sup> I do what is fair and right. Do not abandon me to my oppressors!

      <sup>4</sup> Here&#39;s how! With the sharp arrows of warriors, with arrowheads forged over the hot coals.
      <sup>5</sup> How miserable I am! For I have lived temporarily in Meshech; I have resided among the tents of Kedar.

      <sup>8</sup> For the sake of my brothers and my neighbors I will say, &quot;May there be peace in you!&quot;

      <sup>4</sup> O LORD, restore our well-being, just as the streams in the arid south are replenished.
      <sup>5</sup> Those who shed tears as they plant will shout for joy when they reap the harvest.

      <sup>4</sup> I will not allow my eyes to sleep, or my eyelids to slumber,
      <sup>5</sup> until I find a place for the LORD, a fine dwelling place for the powerful ruler of Jacob.&quot;

      <sup>7</sup> Let us go to his dwelling place! Let us worship before his footstool!
      <sup>8</sup> Ascend, O LORD, to your resting place, you and the ark of your strength!
      <sup>9</sup> May your priests be clothed with integrity! May your loyal followers shout for joy!
      <sup>10</sup> For the sake of David, your servant, do not reject your chosen king!
      <sup>11</sup> The LORD made a reliable promise to David; he will not go back on his word. He said, &quot;I will place one of
      your descendants on your throne.
      <sup>12</sup> If your sons keep my covenant and the rules I teach them, their sons will also sit on your throne
      forever.&quot;

      <sup>16</sup> I will protect her priests, and her godly people will shout exuberantly.
      <sup>17</sup> There I will make David strong; I have determined that my chosen king&#39;s dynasty will continue.

      <sup>13</sup> Your kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and your dominion endures through all generations.
      <sup>14</sup> The LORD supports all who fall, and lifts up all who are bent over.
      <sup>15</sup> Everything looks to you in anticipation, and you provide them with food on a regular basis.
      <sup>16</sup> You open your hand, and fill every living thing with the food they desire.
      <sup>17</sup> The LORD is just in all his actions, and exhibits love in all he does.
      <sup>18</sup> The LORD is near all who cry out to him, all who cry out to him sincerely.
      <sup>19</sup> He satisfies the desire of his loyal followers; he hears their cry for help and delivers them.

      <sup>21</sup> My mouth will praise the LORD. Let all who live praise his holy name forever!</p>

      <sup>1</sup> Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD, O my soul!
      <sup>2</sup> I will praise the LORD as long as I live! I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist!
      <sup>3</sup> Do not trust in princes, or in human beings, who cannot deliver!
      <sup>4</sup> Their life&#39;s breath departs, they return to the ground; on that day their plans die.
      <sup>5</sup> How blessed is the one whose helper is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD his God,
      <sup>6</sup> the one who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, who remains forever faithful,
      <sup>7</sup> vindicates the oppressed, and gives food to the hungry. The LORD releases the imprisoned.
      <sup>8</sup> The LORD gives sight to the blind. The LORD lifts up all who are bent over. The LORD loves the godly.
      <sup>9</sup> The LORD protects those residing outside their native land; he lifts up the fatherless and the widow, but he
      opposes the wicked.
      <sup>10</sup> The LORD rules forever, your God, O Zion, throughout the generations to come! Praise the LORD!</p>
      <p>

      <sup>1</sup> Praise the LORD, for it is good to sing praises to our God! Yes, praise is pleasant and appropriate!
      <sup>2</sup> The LORD rebuilds Jerusalem, and gathers the exiles of Israel.
      <sup>3</sup> He heals the brokenhearted, and bandages their wounds.
      <sup>4</sup> He counts the number of the stars; he names all of them.
      <sup>5</sup> Our Lord is great and has awesome power; there is no limit to his wisdom.
      <sup>6</sup> The LORD lifts up the oppressed, but knocks the wicked to the ground.
      <sup>7</sup> Offer to the LORD a song of thanks! Sing praises to our God to the accompaniment of a harp!
      <sup>8</sup> He covers the sky with clouds, provides the earth with rain, and causes grass to grow on the hillsides.
      <sup>9</sup> He gives food to the animals, and to the young ravens when they chirp.
      <sup>10</sup> He is not enamored with the strength of a horse, nor is he impressed by the warrior&#39;s strong legs.
      <sup>11</sup> The LORD takes delight in his faithful followers, and in those who wait for his loyal love.
      <sup>12</sup> Extol the LORD, O Jerusalem! Praise your God, O Zion!
      <sup>13</sup> For he makes the bars of your gates strong. He blesses your children within you.
      <sup>14</sup> He brings peace to your territory. He abundantly provides for you the best grain.
      <sup>15</sup> He sends his command through the earth; swiftly his order reaches its destination.
      <sup>16</sup> He sends the snow that is white like wool; he spreads the frost that is white like ashes.
      <sup>17</sup> He throws his hailstones like crumbs. Who can withstand the cold wind he sends?
      <sup>18</sup> He then orders it all to melt; he breathes on it, and the water flows.
      <sup>19</sup> He proclaims his word to Jacob, his statutes and regulations to Israel.
      <sup>20</sup> He has not done so with any other nation; they are not aware of his regulations. Praise the LORD!</p>

      <sup>10</sup> you animals and all you cattle, you creeping things and birds,

      <sup>4</sup> For the LORD takes delight in his people; he exalts the oppressed by delivering them.
      <sup>5</sup> Let the godly rejoice because of their vindication! Let them shout for joy upon their beds!
      <sup>6</sup> May they praise God while they hold a two-edged sword in their hand,
      <sup>7</sup> in order to take revenge on the nations, and punish foreigners.
      <sup>8</sup> They bind their kings in chains, and their nobles in iron shackles,
      <sup>9</sup> and execute the judgment to which their enemies have been sentenced. All his loyal followers will be vindicated.
      Praise the LORD!</p>
